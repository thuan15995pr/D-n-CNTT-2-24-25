Chicago, IL – January 25, 2024 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""Total S&P 500 index earnings are currently expected to be up +0.6% from the year-earlier level on +2.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +3.8% earnings growth in 2023 Q3 on +2.0% higher revenues.""
Breaking Down Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard
Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>
Here are the key points:
Total Q4 earnings for the 83 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +0.9% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues, with 78.3% beating EPS estimates and 65.1% beating revenue estimates.
The Q4 earnings growth pace for these 83 index members is below what we had seen from this group of companies in other recent periods, while the 78.3% EPS beats percentage is tracking in-line with the 20-quarter average of 78.2%.
The revenue growth pace for this group of index members represents a deceleration relative to what we had seen from the group in other recent periods, while the 65.1% revenue beats percentage is below recent periods as well as the 20-quarter average of 69.1% for this group of 83 index members.
Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 index earnings are currently expected to be up +0.6% from the year-earlier level on +2.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +3.8% earnings growth in 2023 Q3 on +2.0% higher revenues.
The ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ - Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Nvidia NVDA and others will start reporting Q4 results in the next few days. Total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +38.3% from the same period last year on +12.5% higher revenues, which would follow the group’s +54.2% higher earnings on +12.9% higher revenues in 2023 Q3.
Beyond Big Tech, Q4 earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +0.6% above the year-earlier period on +2.3% higher revenues. This would follow the +3.8% increase in index earnings in 2023 Q3 on +2.0% higher revenues.
Given the expected moderation in the U.S. economy’s growth trajectory due to the cumulative effects of Fed tightening, these estimates likely need to come down. Some of that downward adjustment is already happening.
As we have noted before, full-year 2024 estimates started coming down in October, with the trend continuing in November and early December, but appear to have stabilized in recent weeks.

"February 03, 2024 — 01:07 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-apple-acquire-peloton-in-2024-2-things-investors-should-know-about-the-rumors,"Thanks to its lineup of incredibly popular hardware products, and its budding services and software offerings, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become one of the most valuable businesses on the face of the planet. Its expertise and dominant success in the consumer-focused tech world could be beneficial when it comes to potential acquisitions.
Consider Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON). This once-thriving exercise equipment and app enterprise has experienced falling demand and ongoing net losses. Maybe its turnaround plans could get a boost with some help.
With its massive financial resources, is there a possibility the iPhone maker will go out and buy the struggling fitness company? Here are two important things that investors should know about the ongoing rumors of this deal.
Apple is a worthy buyer
Apple specializes in developing beautiful hardware differentiated by its own proprietary software, which is exactly what Peloton does. The difference is that Apple has maintained lasting success in a profitable manner, thanks to an emphasis on its innovative culture, brand strength, and pricing power. Peloton wants to be just like this.
With the Watch and Fitness+, Apple already has a presence in the health space. CEO Tim Cook said in 2019 that Apple's greatest contribution to humanity ""will be about health."" The overarching goal to improve people's lives is something Peloton shares with Apple.
This deal might make sense strategically. Apple already has over 2 billion active devices. Adding exercise equipment into high-income households would provide another avenue to collect data, and there are neat ways the two companies could find ways to integrate.
For example, Apple Music could provide all the music for Peloton's massive workout catalog. And through Apple Card, Apple could provide certain rewards or incentives to buy a piece of Peloton's hardware.
Apple also has the financial resources to buy Peloton with cash. In fiscal 2023, the tech enterprise produced $100 billion of free cash flow. There is more than enough cash in its coffers.
Peloton would barely move the needle
Now that we've looked at all the compelling reasons that demonstrate why Apple would be a no-brainer buyer for Peloton, let's consider why I don't see this deal happening anytime soon.
For starters, Apple isn't known for a corporate strategy that favors sizable acquisitions. Its largest purchase occurred in 2014 when it bought Beats for $3 billion. At a meaningful premium to Peloton's current market cap of $2.1 billion, a possible takeover would still be in the ballpark as one of Apple's biggest. I don't know if management is trying to do this.
Apple generated $383 billion of revenue in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30). In its fiscal 2023 (ended June 30), Peloton registered sales of $2.8 billion. Even if the exercise company saw its revenue surge under Apple, it still might simply be too small an opportunity.
On the one hand, if this deal did happen, but ended up not working out, the purchase price would be a rounding error for Apple, and shareholders would likely shrug it off. At least executives would have tried something that made strategic sense, but just wasn't in the cards.
But let's say this transaction became a reality, and Peloton was successfully integrated into Apple's operations, with a return to growth and profitability for the fitness business. It still wouldn't move the needle for the tech giant.
Apple basically has the entire global population as its addressable market. Those who are interested in spending a four-figure sum to buy exercise equipment are a tiny fraction of this. Nonetheless, should this deal ever be on the table, it would undoubtedly benefit Peloton much more than Apple.

Dylan Lewis: There's a new king at top of the market and a valuable lesson for investors. Motley Fool Money, starts now.
It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining you in the studio, Motley Fool Senior Analysts Bill Mann and Andy Cross, gentlemen great to have you both here. How are you doing?
Bill Mann: Yes. Nice to be seen.
Dylan Lewis: To see and be seen and be heard as well, Bill, we're going to have you heard as well. We've got to look at the necessity-based approach to retail centers and shopping centers, we've got earnings from Tesla and Netflix, and we've got some legacy names that might be worth a closer look for investors. We're going to start with the new largest name on the market, Andy. This is a company that we have seen at the mountaintop before. It is there again this week. Microsoft opened as the most valuable company in the world passing Apple as they sometimes do jockeying for the crown of most valuable company in the world. What do you make of Microsoft now a little over $3 trillion.
Andy Cross: It is that jockeying, right guys? They're neck and neck, they're right there. By the time someone listens to this, they maybe be switched around again. So they're both outstanding companies, obviously some of the most successful businesses. Certainly in our lifetimes, if not almost ever when you think about just the quality of these businesses and what they have earned in both the marketplace. Interesting Apple this month, so year to date, I know it's only been a few weeks guys, but the stock is up a percent or two or so. When you look at the rest of those large tech companies, Microsoft done very well and of course, Nvidia driving so many of the gains so I think you will just see it continue. They are now separating. Microsoft is starting to separate itself because it's tied to so many things and we saw what it is now trying to do in the gaming business with its Activision Blizzard acquisition of almost $70 billion. So they will be neck and neck. It will be very interesting to see how Apple, if it starts to think about really exploiting or using, I should say, its strength in the computer space and the individual space, the consumer market as it thinks about AI and all those investments. We still have really not heard a whole lot about that from Apple yet.
Dylan Lewis: Bill, I love checking in on Microsoft and the story because it is a good reminder for investors. It was a long road to becoming a $3 trillion company and one of the most valuable companies in the world period, let alone the largest, and there were a lot of periods where it didn't seem as inevitable as it does now for Microsoft.
Bill Mann: No, for a long period of time, Microsoft was pretty much thought to be an also-ran. It had a 14 year period in which it did not reach its previous high so Microsoft was not a company that was being taken seriously as a competitor within that space anymore, and now I'd like to put frames around things. $3 trillion means that Microsoft is worth $428 per man, woman, and child on the planet.
Dylan Lewis: It's humongous.
Bill Mann: It's humongous and you have to wonder, at what point does that just simply become too large for any company to be able to generate that level of economic return. So it's a massive number. I'm not saying they can't. I mean, I think a lot of people have underestimated Microsoft for a long time. Four hundred and twenty eight bucks, that's a lot.
Dylan Lewis: That's incredible. If you add Apple and Microsoft together, you have almost $1,000 per every person.
Bill Mann: Apple, by the way, has been buying back shares. They're not committed to being the largest company in the world by market cap. If they did, they wouldn't be buying back shares at all. I mean, Andy's exactly right, maybe there have never been businesses that have been better at generating returns for investors or economic returns than the two of these.
Dylan Lewis: One of the ways Microsoft is looking for that next phase of growth is gaming. The company recently acquired Activision Blizzard and we did see it was not all good news over at Microsoft this week. There were announced layoffs of 1,900 employees in gaming, many of them are part of the newly acquired Activision Blizzard Group. Andy, what do you make of this as you're processing the news itself and the broader layoff picture we're seeing?
Andy Cross: Well, first on the news Dylan, and not surprising, anytime a company's going to make a significant acquisition, they're going to think of how to rationalize costs, and a lot of these I imagine there's a lot of overhead corporate costs, dual roles they've talked about, and those just are redundant and it doesn't really make sense for the acquiring company as painful as it is for those layoffs to keep those roles and think about trying to get the two companies together in the back office side. What is interesting though is this does come on top of the layoffs that Microsoft had a year ago. Many tech companies as we were seeing, not just in the gaming space, I mean, we're seeing Twitch, we're seeing Unity, we're seeing Riot Games, they are definitely simplifying, reducing their work forces because of some of the gaming slowdown overall. But it does echo with what we are seeing across a lot of the tech sphere when so many companies made so many investments in people. Namely, because I think they were worried they wouldn't be able to get people. During the COVID period, they were just worried about talent, the grab for talent. They made those large investments in those people. They are now starting to deal with that because they are seeing that there are different ways to get value from their assets and it maybe it isn't so much in all of the people, especially as you think about things like how does AI, or how does this technology in general improve the operations of a company that doesn't require having all those employees? So it's painful, but it is a rationalization cost that large companies need to go through.
Bill Mann: Some of it has to do with the fact that Microsoft immediately canceled a game that's been in development for six years code named ""Odyssey"" at Activision. So obviously, a long time investment that Microsoft didn't seem to think was worth to continue to make. A lot of it also has to do with the fact that we are in a different environment now in terms of the cost of funds, and so in 2020 you could throw money at anything, and there was almost no loss to it because money was free. It's not free anymore, even at a company like Microsoft.
Andy Cross: It'll be very interesting to see how this all works out with Microsoft as they continue to push more aggressively at the cloud. How much is X-box units versus X-box cloud and all those different subscriptions? So I think the acquisition is exciting. It is unfortunate and painful for those people who had to let go.
Bill Mann: Always have to remember that that is a human story.
Andy Cross: Yeah, sure.
Dylan Lewis: Before we go to break, we're going to go global. It has been a tough run for the Chinese stock market and for companies based in China over the last few years, but if you're paying attention to some major moves Bill, things might be getting a little interesting. Alibaba co-founders Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai recently bought $200 million in Alibaba shares. Is this signal? Is this this noise?
Bill Mann: Did they? [laughs].
Dylan Lewis: Was it them?
Bill Mann: Was it them? Six trillion dollars in losses in the Chinese stock market from its peak, and that by the way, that is Apple plus Microsoft just wiped off their market gap. And by the way, they didn't start with an Apple at a Microsoft. So it has been a brutal run for China and it's possible you are seeing some moves within China. They reduced their banking reserve ratios that were required in order to get some liquidity into the market, and you are starting to see some big purchases by some of the big shareholders of these companies and I think it is very interesting that they came in with $50 million of Jack Ma's money and $150 million of Joseph Tsai's money that they are backing Alibaba the way they have. Because Alibaba has come up against some real competition in the form of Pinduoduo and its Temu platform.
Dylan Lewis: Bill, when I look at China, I feel like I've seen different chapters of risk and concern with the overall picture there. Some of it was for a very long time government intervention and the lines between private and public, and the strength of public and private enterprises. Some of it also was demographic story. Knowing that we're seeing slowing demographics and slowing population growth, we're going to see some declines there, is there anything else that you're worried about as you look to that picture or anything you feel like we're getting wrong as we look at some of those stories?
Bill Mann: I'm sure we're getting a lot of things wrong in China, but it bears remembering that China has over the last couple of years gone from being a government by committee to really government by one guy. So there are some real concerns in China. There never were in place any real shareholder protections, particularly for international investors into Chinese companies, and I think that people have, you know, they've finally been burned enough times that they're not that excited to go back. There were huge withdrawals from the Chinese market by western investors at the end of this last year. That has continued apace. I think China is at the point where they need to prove that they are a market that is safe for foreign investors before people will get excited about any of the demographic shifts. Actually the demographic shifts aren't that awesome, so that might be anything on top, but it has always been the case. Hey, a billion people and a half in China, that's a huge market. It remains to be the case, but I think people are three times bitten and four times shy at this point.
Dylan Lewis: Is that to say you're not following Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai into shares of Alibaba?
Bill Mann: Alibaba is a company that I actually feel fairly positively about, and have in fact I believe in China, if you want to invest in there, just play the hits and Alibaba is one of them.
Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got a run down on the earnings beat with the results from Tesla and Netflix. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money, I am Dylan Lewis, joined in studio by Bill Mann and Andy Cross. Gentlemen, it was a busy week for earnings, so we are going to dive right in. Bill, Tesla shares down 10 percent after the company reported this week. Results were below expectations. But am I reading it right that a lot of the attention was on the forward-looking growth estimates and a little bit less on what we saw in the reported quarter?
Bill Mann: I think that that's probably true. I mean, in the run-up to the earnings, Elon Musk, the very interesting CEO of this company came out and said that he believed that were there not protections put into place that the Chinese EV manufacturers would pretty much demolish. That's a direct quote, competition around the world. If you've got a $600 billion company that primarily does electric vehicles outside of China, that's something that I think you should pay attention to. I mean, the quarter was expected for them. I'm actually surprised the stock went down as much as it did based on the results because we already knew about the price cuts around the world for their existing fleet.
Dylan Lewis: I was going to say I mean, I think we had to know margins were going to get compressed because of what you were talking about there with the price cuts. We've seen the growing traction and the growing deliveries by BYD. We don't see them on the roads here in the United States, but that is a story we've been aware of. Are you surprised at all that this was the reaction or was there anything in there that really surprised you? Outside of what's getting all the headlines?
Bill Mann: Look, I think that I think that Elon Musk will remain a complete enigma. The fact that he came out and you had balls, longtime balls like Dan Ives come out and say, the things they were talking about during the conference call. These were not executives who were taking responsibility for margin compression. They were not taking responsibility for some of the mistakes that were happening or the environment that Tesla is in. I think you've got to be mindful of the fact that there actually are many more questions that are being asked about Tesla, including things in governance like Elon Musk came out and basically said that he wants 25 percent of the company, as if he's not already, deeply incentivized enough with the billions and billions of ownership he has of the company. There are some real questions there. A lot of them have been a long time coming.
Dylan Lewis: Tough week for Tesla, great week for Netflix. Andy shares the streamer up 15 percent this week following earnings that showed the company can still add subscribers.
Andy Cross: The story of two different leaders in two different spaces. I mean, this was a clear case of the clear leader in streaming, Showcasing, gosh, Oscar Worthy status. By adding 13.1 million streaming subscribers, pushing this stock to a two-year high, still far below 20 percent below its all-time high. But as they continue to make investments, including the WWE Raw investment, they made for $5 billion reportedly over 10 years. The outstanding strategy of testing and learning into all these different parts of the market. International expansion live entertainment documentaries, sports documentaries, gaming. With really no corporate acquisitions, they do it all internal house. Netflix is now the go-to space for creators because they know they're going to get the eyeballs, 260 million global subscribers like I just mentioned. They added 13.12 million this quarter. That's 50 percent above expectations and the most since 2020. It almost doubled the ads they had a year ago. The United States was the slowest growing, one of the slowest-growing parts of the market. But they still added 2.8 million. In the US and in Canada, the advertising membership grew 70 percent and equals 40 percent of all new subs in markets where they have the advertising tier, a lot of those new additions are coming in the advertising tier, revenue was up 12.5 percent versus up six percent a year ago, operating income was at 1.5 billion. That was up 172 percent. When you just look at the Netflix story, they continue to widen their lead over the competition, which is a little bit of a disarray, I think it's safe to say. The programming they're making and the success they're having on both the programming for their viewers who see Netflix as the place that I have to maintain my streaming subscription above anything else and that's showing up in the results.
Bill Mann: I thought it was super interesting in their report that they basically came out and said that they intend to raise prices a little bit over time. This is a company that is fully confident with where they are right now. What a shock from two years ago.
Dylan Lewis: Unbelievable, one of my questions here, Andy, with looking at Netflix is we have seen the push for, we're going to crack down on password sharing. We've seen the push into ads. Do we have to continue to expect this growth? Do we have to think those were quick levers and maybe that we can't expect that growth going forward?
Andy Cross: Oh gosh, I think just the different ways. Like they're just starting to get into the gaming. They had some grand theft auto stuff last year. Like I mentioned in different documentaries. They're going to have different live programming events. The WWE, that acquisition of that content for Raw in the licensing agreement and international other assets, that plays really well into their strength. Again, I know $5 billion and a lot of money. They're going to invest 17 billion in programming just this year alone. But that's the way that Netflix has been able to build these properties out. They leak out a little content, they try things, they see what works, they don't, they get the data and they make those smart investments that play out for their members. I think it'll be, I'm not worried about their ability to innovate and find new things for us to enjoy on Netflix.
Dylan Lewis: We're going to wrap the earnings chat by checking in on Big Blue. Bill, IBM shares up eight percent post earnings, sending the stock to its highest level since 2013. What has the market so excited about IBM?
Bill Mann: IBM is like the nickelback of AI companies. Isn't it? Like nobody wants to admit that they like it because, I mean, it's a company that's disappointed for so long. It is one of the few companies in the last decade that Warren Buffett bought and sold in disgust because they didn't do any of the things that he thought that they were going to do. But IBM has a 25-year library and a head start in AI. They've been doing it for a long time. It is not by accident that you go back and you remember that Big Blue, which was an AI device was IBM's and that's what competed against Gary Kasparov and chess. That was a long time ago. They are now seeing the market catch up with them. One of the reasons that you don't see IBM talked about it as an AI company is that they don't do anything customer-facing. They are doing things which make a lot of sense. When you think about some of the issues with Chat GPT of providing like a ring fence around company's private data. Allows it to interact with public data in AI without compromising that private data. It's a really, really interesting business. Nice to see them get a bid. They're at a multi-year high. And by multi, I mean many, many year high. I think it may be just the beginning for IBM.
Dylan Lewis: Bill I can't help but think back to the conversation we were having earlier about Microsoft and that lost period. I think there's probably a younger generation of investors that have not had IBM on their radar at all because it has been during this very tough period for the business. It sounds like you're saying maybe this is one that should be on people's radar.
Bill Mann: I think it absolutely should be. Look back and it wasn't that many years ago that the Fang acronym was invented and they left Microsoft off, that was the biggest winner, to me, IBM has the potential, and that's a really important word to be, on the same trajectory as an Nvidia or a Microsoft. A company that has been minding its business and not really in a wonderful way for a long time, but they have actually been still building things while they were going, they invested in R&D the entire time. I think you're now starting to see a payoff.
Dylan Lewis: IBM saying, hey, I want to be a rock star. It's your nickel back example there, Bill Mann, Andy Cross, we're going to see a little bit later in the show. Up next we've got a rundown on why grocery stores are a bigger part of the retail picture. Stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money, I'm Dylan Lewis. As some of you are listening to this very radio show, you might be out on the roads driving your car, maybe passing a strip mall or shopping center and you might notice that the formula for retail has changed a bit in recent years. Increasingly, supermarkets and medical services are the features of the modern shopping center and that's partially the work of Jeffrey Edison. He's the co-founder and CEO of Philip's Edison Company. They are a real estate investment trust focused on retail with over 275 locations in 31 states. Motley Fool Money's Deidre Woollard caught up with Edison to understand the importance of necessity based goods in retail, what consumers want right now, both in terms of concepts and convenience and how foot traffic is trending in shopping centers.
Deidre Woollard: I want to talk about the journey of this company because you were in the private markets a long time. You've only been publicly traded since 2021. You came to the market in an interesting time. How is being public changed the company or changed how you think about things, if at all?
Jeffrey Edison: Surprise. I hate to date myself, but we've been doing this for 30 years. We started the business 30 years ago. Bought a grocery anchored shopping center in Virginia, and we've continued for a sustained period of time now, 30 years, staying in that business and developing what we think is the best team operating in that particular niche. Our niche is, we buy shopping centers that are anchored by the number 1 or 2 grocer and they're in markets where the market supports not only the grocer, which is about 35-40 percent of the space, but also the small stores. What we've targeted is that center where when somebody wakes up on a Saturday in the suburbs, they go to get their necessity based goods. They get their groceries, they get their hair done, they get their nails done, maybe they get a workout in and get a smoothie. We want to be the place near their home where they go to do that type of thing. We continue to build this team over a sustained period of time. You just started with friends and family and went into institutional funds and then got into the non traded at space, raised equity there, and we got to a size where being a listed public company and the access that gave us to capital was a logical next step in that process. It really hasn't been a major change for us. I mean, we've been SEC filing for over 10 years, so all the reporting stuff was all common stuff that we've done and we're actually one of the only companies to come public where it was simpler from a reporting standpoint than it was before when we had multiple different groups. It's been for us, a journey but where we're learning a lot about our new set of investors and how that, and a lot of our investors have stayed with us over that period of time, through that whole process and have been great supporters of us. Those were almost all retail investors. Now we're much more involved with the institutional investors. But our retail investors are still at a core ownership of the company.
Deidre Woollard: You mentioned big grocery stores, one of the biggest ones has been involved in this merger. I'm talking about Kroger and Albertsons, of course, major tenant of yours. We just found out that it's going to be a little while longer before that merger takes place. They pushed it back. Does that new extended timeline have any impact on you or how are you thinking about that merger in general?
Jeffrey Edison: I think in general, if it happens, it will be a positive impact on us because it will take a grocer that is going through other stuff and put them in a much more, really strong financial position. The market still is very reluctant to say whether it's going to happen or not. Albertsons trading 15 percent below where the strike price is on the merger. The market, which we look at pretty closely is still questioning whether they're going to get SEC approval and what that process will go through. These are really strong grocery locations where they will be grocery stores on a long term basis. That improved capital that will come back with a Kroger ownership we think would have a positive impact on our overall portfolio. We're Kroger's largest landlord, we're Public's second largest landlord. We're working with the grocers and have been now for 30 years on how their business works and where they can be successful.
Deidre Woollard: Interesting. Well, I listened to your investor day and one of the things that I heard you and the team talk about is medical. I've heard this from other red operators as well. Tell us a little bit more about it. What type of medical are you seeing? Are you seeing chains or local operators? What's the story there?
Jeffrey Edison: Retail is always changing and what a lot of people are realizing is that they have to do what the consumer wants, and that is in all parts of retail. What's happening, and we call it medtail. Ln the medtail side, is they're seeing the advantages primarily on a cost basis but also on a convenience basis for the customer being closer to them. We're seeing a wide variety of different medical uses coming into our shopping centers. They are long term players who will be in our centers for a long term. They bring additional convenience to the markets that we're in. They're an important part of our growth in Tennessee over time. It includes everything from the chiropractor to the physical therapy, to the dentist, to urgent care. All of those are part of that and some people are even including veterinary services for the animals in that medtail category. It's a strong growing part of the demand for our shopping centers.
Deidre Woollard: I'm wondering what foot traffic trends you've seen in the post pandemic time. Certainly, we always talk about the death of retail being overstated. Have you seen a lot of return to your shopping centers?
Jeffrey Edison: Yeah. I think the days of that conversation are limited. It's almost all being driven by two factors, one, the increased demand and the other the lack of new supply. For the last 10 years, there's been very little new retail product. There's been more destroyed retail than there has been a created retail. What that's done, it's really limited the supply. At the same time we've had a great operating environment for our suburban located centers. Because if you look at suburbanization, that's a trend that has continued which we think is very positive for us. Working from home is a big part of that because people are around our centers more of the day. Rather than being in the office and going down to have lunch, they'll go to the shopping center and have lunch. That's been very positive for us.
Jeffrey Edison: There's a sense of buying local, which is our centers are great for, 27 percent of our neighbors are local in nature and they've been with us on average nine years in our centers. These are bringing something unique to the merchandising mix of our center and an important part of why our centers have continued to operate at a really high level. I think we're 98 percent occupied today, the highest level we've been at in the 30 year history. It's a really positive operating by. Those macro tailwinds are not short term. I mean, from our perspective, we think there's going to continue to be suburbanization, continue to be work from home, continue to be migration to the sun belt. All of those are long term trends and we believe that rents have to go up somewhere between 50 and 100 percent before really new development is economically warranted, which is a major move.
Deidre Woollard: What do you think in terms of how tenants are using space? We've seen so much change to curbside pick up and things like that.
Jeffrey Edison: The retailers are really good at what they do and they're very good at reading where the consumer is. It's very expensive to acquire new shoppers to your store, so you don't want to lose any of your shoppers. Because of that, today's shopper wants an omnichannel approach to retail. They want to be able to go and have BOPUS and pick it up at the store. They want to go in and shop the store and they want to be able to order online and have it delivered to their house. Our retailers have to have that omnichannel approach. It's going to be long term successful from our opinion. What we've done, I think I'll get the numbers wrong a little bit, but it's like 90 percent of our grocers have BOPUS so that you can order it, pick it up at the store and do it. It's in the high '90s. We have a front row to go, which is our program where we have dedicated parking spaces for our small store spaces so they can get that. Then we've had an extensive program of getting drive-throughs continuously added to our shopping center. Again, all the pieces that the consumer wants trying to create those for them.
Dylan Lewis: Listeners, if you see something interesting related to investing while you're out in the world, we want to hear about it. Shoot any questions or ideas for show topics over to radio at Fool.com. Coming up after the break, Bill Mann and Andy Cross return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool Money.
As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined again by Bill Mann and Andy Cross. We've got one more earning story before we get over to our radar stocks. Andy, it's going to be a name that we don't talk about all the time on the show, but I think it's worth bringing up because some interesting results, and some interesting insights, and maybe to the future of streaming in what we saw from Comcast this week.
Andy Cross: Well, in the news too, after they hosted the Chiefs, Bill's playoff game on Peacock, which was criticized a lot of course. But when they decided to go purely with streaming, but there's still 23 million viewers tuned into that. That was a huge success, and they talked a lot about that in the call. I mean, it's $182 billion market cap company, that's still smaller than Netflix is very interesting, but still a very large company and many subscribers. Of course, the revenue was flat, up 2.3 percent during the quarter EBITDA. They're earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization flat. What's interesting though, Dylan, is that so much talk about the subscriber base. The connected broadband subscribers were basically flat. They continue to see people leave for video who don't want to have video and the phone. But when you look at the broadband business, and you look at their mobile business, the mobile business actually is doing quite well. Revenue with subscribers grew more than 20 percent in that quarter. Broadband about flat. What was really interesting is the Peacock, that streaming platform that they have launched. Revenues in Peacock was up 57 percent and hit 1 billion for the first time ever in a quarter. The subscriber revenues were up 88 percent and advertising was up 50 percent. If you back out some of the effects of the World Cup from last year, so much talk about Peacock, is that the future for Comcast, it will be a big part of their growth is right now, pretty much the only exciting part to the growth picture for Comcast. But you've got a company that basically sells at 10-12 times earnings per share. a middling grower stock, not super exciting, but also not super volatile. If that's your interest, Comcast might be worth it.
Dylan Lewis: I remember seeing the story that they had spent about $110 millions for the exclusive streaming rights to that playoff game. Based on data we saw from Antenna, they wound up with just under 3 million new subscribers during the days leading up to that game. Do you feel like that was money well spent for Peacock?
Andy Cross: I think it is. If you just think again long term, and the benefit, and the more and more push toward streaming. Their advertising business is strong on the streaming. When you start looking at the investments they're making in there and the experiences they have. Of course, with all the other advertising properties they have, and with the theme parks, and all that thing. But making the right investments in Peacock and 23 million people viewing that. That is an impressive number when you look at just the previous one of the other NFL games, it was, I think, a second highest. That game was on broadcast TV, so this was just on Peacock. Obviously, we'll have to see the investments they make and will they ultimately pay out. But I think from an initial go, there's some excitement behind what's happening at Peacock.
Bill Mann: Was it actually an NFL game, or was it actually just another Taylor site?
Andy Cross: Yes, exactly. Now, maybe if you X out the Chiefs and somebody else, we'll have to see.
Dylan Lewis: That would be an incredibly captivating exclusive if they were able to get Taylor Swift exclusives. I wouldn't be surprised if that drove three million sign-ups as well.
Andy Cross: I will say Peacock did lose $2.7 billion last year, so they have a long way to go to catch up to the likes of Netflix. But at least they are pushing aggressively into that streaming business.
Bill Mann: That's one 200th of what China has lost. They're in great shape. They're fine. To me, ultimately, it's a sheriff eyeball. They brought subscribers in. Will those subscribers stick? It is only down to their willingness to continue to consume content from Peacock.
Andy Cross: Bill, for folks watching the NFL games this weekend, there's some splash around Peacock. But also I think there are going to be a lot of ads for the sports betting sites, DraftKings, MGM, and Caesar's advertising heavily trying to get a lot of users, a lot of new people acquired during this period. We'll have to wait until earnings to see if that pays off, but what are some of your impressions, seeing some of that?
Bill Mann: I think it's been a really fascinating five years for sports betting in the US. Because you have gone from the major leagues, keeping them at arm's length. Then all of a sudden like nudge, nudge, wink at arm's length. Now, you're seeing things where ESPN is going to buy part of one of a betting network and NFL might buy part of ESPN. Betting it's not just that it's here to stay, but it is going to become a more and more integral part of the sports viewing experience for a lot of people, I think.
Andy Cross: I think it's going to be very hard for them to separate the egg whites and the egg yolk at a certain point, it is going to be scrambled together.
Bill Mann: That's a great allegory because I don't know how they would undo it if it does, in fact, impact competition.
Dylan Lewis: Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Andy, you're up first. What are you looking at this?
Andy Cross: Guys, I'm looking at Spotify ticker S-P-O-T. I'm sticking with the streaming theme here, but turning more toward the ears rather than the eyes, 226 million paying subscribers of about $11 per month, which I'm sure many of us are over 570 million total monthly active users. They can access 100 million digital tracks, 5 million accounting podcasts, and that's a big part of what their business is. A $41 billion market cap with almost 4 billion in cash and a little more than $1.2 billion of debt, 88 percent of revenues come from those subscriptions. But advertising is where some of the excitement is. I know one thing we're excited about, they report earnings in a couple of weeks. I'm really interested to see what they are doing on the margin side. They unfortunately had to go through some of those other layoffs we talked about. They let go of a lot of people last year. There was some excitement, enthusiasm that might really boost the profitability. Analysts are expecting profits this year, so looking to see what Dan act and his team is saying about Spotify. About the market, the investments and the cost that they've been able to save and how that's going to impact profits and margins.
Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Spotify.
Dan Boyd: More of a comment about Spotify. I hate their app, I really do. It's slow. It sucks. I don't love it, but I still pay for it. I think that says something about the company.
Dylan Lewis: It sure does. Spotify's shareholders, thank you for that, Dan.
Dan Boyd: The hate listen is as good as a love listen.
Dylan Lewis: A shameless plug to our radio audience if you like, Motley Fool Money. Also available on Spotify as well as iTunes. Wherever you get your podcasts, Bill, what is on your radar this week?
Bill Mann: I want to talk about Mercado Libre. There is something fascinating to me, and this has been one of the most successful companies on the US exchanges over the last 20 years. An absolute miraculous growth story in Latin America. I say miraculous purposefully, because their largest market has been Argentina. Argentina is a long term disaster of an economy. But they have a new president now, Javier Milei, who is saying that he wants to dollarize the economy. That he wants, Argentina to privatize a lot of their economy. It's very heavily state owned. It's going to be really interesting to see from Mercado Libre's standpoint because if you think about it, in some ways it's an advantage for them to know how to operate in a basket case economy like Argentina. If it becomes simpler to operate in Argentina, does that help companies like Sea Limited who have been trying to come into Latin America if the ground becomes more simple? To me, Mercado Libre has an opportunity, but it has a little bit of risk wrapped up into it.
Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Mercado Libre.
Dan Boyd: The stock has been a powerhouse over the last couple of years, that's for sure. But is the general strike that was called on Wednesday in Argentina going to be a problem looking forward.
Bill Mann: You said Wednesday? Not the Tuesday one or the last Wednesday one. I think they will be fine. They are very accustomed to operating in an economy where things are just a little wild.
Dylan Lewis: Dan, which one's on your list?
Dan Boyd: It's not Spotify. I'll tell you that.
Dylan Lewis: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. Show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Dylan Lewis. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.

"February 03, 2024 — 07:40 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/forget-amd-in-2024%3A-2-ai-stocks-to-buy-instead,"Shares in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are up more than 130% year over year, fueled by a stellar growth year for artificial intelligence (AI). The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 sent countless chip stocks soaring as Wall Street grew bullish over the companies developing the hardware necessary to run and train AI models.
With the second-largest market share in graphics processing units (GPUs) and plans to begin shipping a new AI chip this year, AMD has significant potential in the industry over the long term. However, just because a company has a leading position in an industry doesn't necessarily mean it's trading at the right price.
AMD's earnings have yet to reflect its heavy investment in the market, which has seen its forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) rise 58% since last January to a pricey 45. Meanwhile, its free cash flow has plunged 47% to just over $1 billion in the same period. As a result, shares in AMD are potentially riskier than AI stocks trading at a better value or in better financial standing.
Data by YCharts
This chart shows AMD has the second-highest forward P/E among some of the most prominent AI firms, indicating its stock offers far less value than companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Consequently, it could be worth considering alternative stocks while you wait for AMD's shares to come down to a more attractive price point.
So, forget AMD in 2024. Here are two AI stocks to buy instead.
1. Microsoft
Microsoft emerged as one of the biggest threats in AI last year when heavy investment in OpenAI gave it access to some of the start-up's most advanced AI models. The Windows company has used OpenAI's technology to carve out a lucrative role in the industry, introducing AI features across its product lineup.
In 2023, Microsoft added new AI tools to its cloud platform Azure, integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its search engine Bing, and boosted productivity in its Office software suite with the help of AI.
Meanwhile, the company is taking early steps to monetize its new offerings, launching an AI assistant called Copilot through its Microsoft 365 subscription service. The company describes the assistant as ""your everyday AI companion."" Some of its generative capabilities include creating a first draft in Word, generating a full PowerPoint presentation based on a simple prompt, and producing data visualizations in seconds in Excel.
Copilot has debuted as a $30 per month add-on to a 365 membership, which could lead to significant earnings boosts for Microsoft.
Microsoft's AI potential has seen its stock soar 64% year over year, with 8% of that since the start of 2024. Its impressive rise allowed it to overtake Apple's market cap and become the most valuable company in the world. Microsoft has shown no signs of slowing and could be in for a stellar 2024.
Moreover, Microsoft hit over $62 billion in free cash flow in 2023, indicating it has the funds to continue investing in AI and stay ahead of the competition. Alongside a significantly lower forward P/E than AMD, Microsoft is a no-brainer to invest in AI this year.
2. Intel
Shares in Intel are down nearly 13% since Jan. 25, when it released its fourth quarter of 2023 earnings. The company posted revenue growth of 10% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $230 million. During the quarter, Intel enjoyed significant gains from a recovering PC market.
However, that wasn't enough to overshadow weak guidance that sent its stock tumbling. Intel expects Q1 2024 earnings to reach $0.13 per share when analysts forecasted $0.42 per share. Meanwhile, the company projects revenue to come in between $12 billion and $13 billion, considerably below the $14 billion that Wall Street expected.
A boom in AI has seen a shift in the chip market, with server demand for GPUs soaring as demand for central processing units (CPUs) has faltered. Intel has dominated the CPU market for years, with its weak guidance reflecting this change.
The weak guidance demonstrates why keeping a long-term perspective is crucial when investing in tech stocks and budding industries like AI.
Intel is heavily investing in the generative technology that could help the company come back strong over the next decade. Last December, Intel unveiled a range of AI chips, including Gaudi3, a GPU designed to challenge similar offerings from Nvidia and AMD. The tech giant also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which both include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently.
The chipmaker's recent challenges make Intel a long-term play. However, its forward P/E of 32 makes it one of the cheapest AI stocks among AMD, Nvidia, and Amazon. The company could offer major gains over the long term as it continues expanding in AI and restructures its business to prioritize GPU production and profit growth. Intel is an exciting option in 2024 and a far better value than AMD.

"February 03, 2024 — 05:00 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-unstoppable-growth-etf-to-turn-%24100-per-month-into-%24518000-while-barely-lifting-a-finger,"Investing in the stock market is one of the most effective ways to build long-term wealth, and with stock prices on the rise, now could be a fantastic time to buy.
The S&P 500 recently reached a new all-time high, soaring by nearly 38% from its low point in October 2022. But just because the index has reached new heights doesn't mean it's not a good time to buy. Prices could have much higher to climb, and by investing now, you can take advantage of those potential gains.
It's more important than ever, though, to invest in the right places. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be fantastic investments for those looking for a safer and lower-effort option -- and there's one ETF that could turn just $100 per month into more than half a million dollars.
Building wealth with the right ETF
An ETF is a basket of securities bundled together into a single investment, and each fund can contain dozens or even hundreds of stocks. By investing in just one ETF, you'll instantly own a stake in all the stocks within it -- making it easier to build a well-diversified portfolio.
There are many ETFs to choose from, but one particularly strong option is the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG). This ETF contains 208 stocks with the potential for above-average growth, and it's designed to beat the market over time.
Historically, it's managed to achieve that goal. Over the past five years, it's earned total returns of more than 129%, while the S&P 500 has seen returns of around 86% in that time.
The difference is even more impressive over the long term. Since its inception in 2004, VUG has earned total returns of around 544%, compared to the S&P 500's total returns of 326% in that time. While there are never any guarantees when it comes to the stock market, and past performance doesn't predict future returns, this ETF does have a solid history of outperforming the market.
Balancing risk and reward
The Vanguard Growth ETF also has a healthy balance of risk and reward in its mix of stocks. Growth ETFs, in general, tend to be riskier than broad-market funds like an S&P 500 ETF, as growth stocks are often more volatile than more established stocks.
However, the fund's top 10 holdings make up around half of its total composition, and these stocks are household names like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, and Tesla. While these stocks may not experience explosive growth, they're also more stable than many smaller growth stocks -- limiting your risk.
The other half of the fund, then, is made up of nearly 200 smaller stocks. These stocks can carry more risk, but they also have more room for growth. If any one of them becomes a superstar performer, you could potentially earn much higher-than-average returns.
How to turn $100 per month into $518,000
Again, there are no guarantees when investing in the stock market. So, although this ETF has performed well in the past, that doesn't necessarily mean it will continue earning similar returns in the future.
That said, this ETF is designed to outperform the market over time. Over the past 10 years, it's earned an average rate of return of about 14% per year. To play it safe, though, let's assume your investment only earns average returns of 12% per year going forward -- which is slightly higher than the market's historic average of 10% per year.
If you're investing $100 per month while earning a 12% average annual return, here's approximately how much you could accumulate over time:
NUMBER OF YEARS TOTAL PORTFOLIO VALUE
20 $86,000
25 $160,000
30 $290,000
35 $518,000
40 $921,000
Data source: Author's calculations via investor.gov.
To reach $518,000 in total savings, you'll need to invest consistently for around 35 years. But if you have even a few more years to invest, you could potentially earn far more.
Similarly, the more you're able to contribute each month, the more you can earn over time. If you were to invest $200 per month, for example, you'd have just over $1 million after 35 years, all other factors remaining the same. With $300 per month, you'd reach nearly $1.6 million in that time.
Not every investment will fit every portfolio, but if you're looking for an ETF with a history of earning above-average returns over time, the Vanguard Growth ETF could be a smart option. With enough time and consistency, you could potentially earn hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.

"February 03, 2024 — 03:11 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/prediction%3A-bitcoin-will-reach-%24100000-in-2025,"Since its price cratered 65% in 2022, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has come roaring back. Last year, it surged 154%, thanks to strong gains within the overall cryptocurrency and stock markets.
At a price of just over $43,000 as of Feb. 1, Bitcoin remains well off its peak price of nearly $69,000 in November 2021. Bullish investors are sure that there is a lot more upside when it comes to the world's most valuable cryptocurrency.
I think Bitcoin is on its way to reaching $100,000 sometime in 2025. Let's take a closer look at why.
Bitcoin's best features
I think it's important to first understand what makes Bitcoin special. Yes, this is a cryptocurrency. But it stands out among the tens of thousands out there because it is truly decentralized and not controlled by a single entity or a group of people. This is why the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already said that Bitcoin is a commodity, like wheat or gold, rather than a stock-like security.
Bitcoin can be compared to gold or a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, as opposed to equities like Apple or Tesla stock. But Bitcoin has far superior value-holding characteristics.
For starters, Bitcoin is more portable, divisible, and transactable than gold. And even more important, there will only ever be 21 million coins in circulation. This makes it absolutely finite. Gold, which has long been viewed as the best store of value, can experience a rise in supply should there be a surge in demand. Bitcoin's inflation rate, on the other hand, is already predetermined. Demand cannot influence supply.
By comparison, the deficiencies of the U.S. dollar are strikingly obvious. Whereas fiat currencies are controlled by the central banks, which helps explain why money supply has skyrocketed in the last decade, no central authority can alter how Bitcoin operates. And this makes it an attractive asset to own that isn't influenced by ongoing money printing and the tweaking of interest rates.
Bitcoin's catalysts
Earlier this year, the SEC approved numerous spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, a highly anticipated event. Since that day on Jan. 10 to the evening of Feb. 1, Bitcoin's price has fallen 8%. The short-term price decline distracts from a more important topic.
In the world of traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin has become a legitimate asset. It has a stamp of approval from the SEC, and there is now an easy way for both individual and institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This seems like a positive development.
However, I believe the most important thing to watch out for in the near term is the upcoming halving, set to take place in April. Happening every four years, the halving cuts the reward that miners receive for approving transactions in half. Historically, during the several months leading up to a halving, and the several months after one, Bitcoin has benefited from a raging bull market.
It makes sense. Decreasing new supply is met with higher levels of demand, which, according to basic economic theory, will result in a higher price.
There are a lot of reasons to appreciate Bitcoin. It has interesting qualities that make it easy to understand why it has become one of the best-performing assets in the last decade, with a current market cap of $844 billion. But I think the upcoming halving will be a major catalyst that will propel the continuation of what has been a strong run for Bitcoin.
And by the end of 2025, it's totally reasonable for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high and break the six-figure mark of $100,000. All the stars are aligning.

China stocks continue to struggle
Chinese stocks started off the month on the wrong foot as China reported GDP growth of just 5.2% for 2023. While that would be a good pace for any country, it marked China's slowest yearly growth in 30 years, and its GDP growth slowed to just 4.1% in the fourth quarter. It's expected to remain around that pace in 2024.
Investors also seemed spooked that Beijing told some investors not to sell Chinese stock amid a rotation among some money managers from China to Japan. Later in the month, a court ordered the liquidation of China Evergrande Group, once the country's biggest real estate developer. That was the latest sign of weakness in China's real estate sector.
Those news items all pressured China stocks further, while JD, PDD, and Baidu faced their own challenges.
JD.com was the worst performer of the past three months even though there was little company-specific news out on the stock. JD shares fell sharply through 2023 as the company posted near-flat growth for much of the year. It has lost market share to PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo, which has been growing rapidly through its social commerce model, which offers discounted prices for group buyers.
Back in December, founder Richard Liu urged the company to be more competitive and acknowledged that JD.com was big, bloated, and inefficient. The remarks echoed a similar call to action from Alibaba founder Jack Ma.
PDD Holdings, meanwhile, was able to brush off the broader weakness in China for the first half of the month but sank toward the end of January.
That weakness seemed to relate to analyst comments that the boom from its Temu e-commerce app in international markets could be peaking. The success of Temu helped drive PDD's revenue up 94% in the third quarter, though that growth is likely to decelerate soon, since it's difficult for any retailer to double sales each quarter, especially a company that's approaching a run rate of $40 billion in revenue.
Finally, Baidu's stock fell in the middle of the month after an article came out linking its Ernie AI platform to military research, which could spark a response from the U.S. government, which has already tightened restrictions over what chips can be exported to China.
Baidu, which is China's search leader, denied the report, but that did little to help spark a recovery in the stock.

Will China stocks recover?
At this point, there seems to be little reason to expect a recovery in the China tech sector. Apple just reported a sales decline in China, offering further evidence of the weak economy. While PDD has been a winner thanks to its rapid growth, the outlook for the economy in general looks challenging.
If you're looking for a Chinese stock, PDD seems to make the most sense of the bunch here, given its rapid growth. Baidu's AI chatbot also seems promising, but investors may want to tread cautiously in the sector, as the economic malaise in China seems likely to continue.

"February 02, 2024 — 07:47 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/magnificent-7-earnings-results-solidify-market-leadership,"We have seen some awe-inspiring results from Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, and Amazon AMZN in recent days that reconfirm their leadership position in this market.
These companies, along with their peers in the ‘Magnificent 7’ group of stocks – Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Tesla TSLA, and Nvidia NVDA – led the market higher last year, and that momentum has continued this year.
Other than Tesla, whose results disappointed the market once again and reflected the fourth quarter in a row of disappointing results, all of the other Mag 7 members that have reported came out with impressive growth numbers. The market wasn’t particularly impressed with the Alphabet and Apple reports, but they came out with Q4 earnings growth of +51.8% and +13.1%, respectively.
Tesla’s earnings were down -45.8% in Q3 on +3.5% higher revenues, as the EV-maker continued to grapple with weakening margins in an increasingly competitive EV market.
The chart below shows the one-year performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks relative to the S&P 500 index and Tesla.

Using estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its December-quarter results on February 21st, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +48.7% from the same period last year on +14.5% higher revenues.
The chart below shows the group’s Q4 earnings and revenue growth performance in the context of what we saw from the group in the preceding quarter and what is currently expected for the next three quarters.

The chart below shows the group’s earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.

Please note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 28.6% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 19.5% of the index’s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 23.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.
The chart below shows the group’s earnings contribution to the index over time and what is currently expected for the next two years.

Given their enormous earnings power and growth profiles, it is hard to argue with the group’s market leadership. Importantly, analysts had been raising their estimates for the group even before the December-quarter results, with these numbers now adding to the positive revision momentum.
Beyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.

This week’s blockbuster Tech results has pushed the aggregate earnings growth picture for the S&P 500 index to +4.3% from last week’s +1.1% growth pace. Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 stocks, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -4.2%, as the chart below shows.

"February 02, 2024 — 05:12 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/judge-certifies-apple-app-store-class-action,"By Jonathan Stempel
Feb 2 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday said tens of millions of Apple AAPL.O customers can pursue a class action accusing the company of monopolizing the market for iPhone apps by banning purchases outside its App Store, leading to higher prices.
U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had in March 2022 refused to certify a class action, but changed her mind after the class was narrowed to include only Apple account holders who spent $10 or more on app or in-app content.
While remaining ""concerned"" that the narrowed class might include more than 10 million accounts that suffered no harm, or 7.9% of the total, Rogers said that number could be reduced and there was no fixed ""cutoff"" for denying certification.
The Oakland, California-based judge also rejected Apple's bid to exclude testimony it considered unreliable from two expert witnesses, including Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel McFadden, about how it may have harmed consumers.
Apple, based in Cupertino, California, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Mark Rifkin, a lawyer for the consumers, said he was ""extremely pleased"" and looked forward to the next phase of the 12-year-old antitrust case. He estimated that the class incurred ""billions of dollars in damages.""
Class actions can result in greater recoveries at less cost than if plaintiffs are forced to sue individually.
Rogers has also overseen ""Fortnite"" videogame creator Epic Games' antitrust case against Apple.
In Sept. 2021 she ordered Apple to loosen restrictions on where developers can seek payment from customers for their apps, but stopped short of requiring Apple to allow downloads to iPhones outside its App Store.
A federal appeals court upheld much of that ruling in April 2023, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to get involved last month.
The case is In re Apple iPhone Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 11-06714.

"February 02, 2024 — 03:59 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-tech-crushes-earnings%3A-which-one-should-you-buy,"We saw a slew of earnings this week from the market’s leading stocks, and they didn’t disappoint. In addition to many other companies that reported earnings, five of the ‘Magnificent 7’ informed us of their performance.
On Tuesday, we heard from Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL, and then on Thursday afternoon from Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, and Meta Platforms META.
All these market leading companies have put up incredible stock performance over the last 18 months, and it looks like that trend may well continue. In this article we are going to take a look at the quarterly earnings reports, valuations, and Zacks Ranks, and attempt to identify which are the most attractive investments right now.

Earnings Summaries
Microsoft: Q2 2024 saw Microsoft soar past expectations with 18% revenue growth and a 33% EPS jump. Their cloud product, Azure, fueled the gain with a 30% surge and doubled its AI integration showcasing commitment to the future. However, a lower-than-expected Q3 revenue forecast was a notable concern. Despite this, Microsoft remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its thriving cloud business and dedication to AI advancements.
Alphabet: While Q4 2023 earnings for Alphabet topped EPS estimates by 2%, ad revenue missed expectations slightly, leading to a stock price dip despite an overall 14% YoY sales growth. Their cloud business continues to shine, but concerns linger about growth in the core advertising engine. With a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold), may be a bit less appealing based on earnings estimate trends.
Amazon: Q4 2023 earnings were music to investors' ears with Amazon exceeding estimates on both revenue and EPS. Their cloud computing arm, AWS, continues to be a major growth driver, and advertising revenue also surpassed expectations. This positive report led to a stock price rise and solidified Amazon's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.
Apple: Q1 2024 earnings saw Apple beat analyst expectations for both revenue and EPS. Revenue grew 2% YoY to $119.6 billion, and EPS increased 16% YoY to $2.18. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, Services revenue reached an all-time high, suggesting a shift towards recurring income streams. The company also achieved a record number of active devices. Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.
Meta Platforms: Q4 2023 earnings surpassed expectations, leading to a more than 20% surge in stock price. Both revenue and EPS beat analyst estimates, with revenue growing 25% YoY. The company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend and a $50 billion stock buyback, further contributing to investor excitement. Metaverse investment continues, and its profitability remains a concern for some investors. META has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.
Valuations
The chart below shows the forward earnings multiples of each of the stocks discussed in this article. We can see that GOOGL and META have the lowest, near 20x, and AMZN has the highest at 43.5x.
AAPL and MSFT are in the middle of the pack with 28.4x and 36.2x respectively.
It is also worth noting that AMZN, META and GOOGL are all below their 10-year median valuations, while AAPL and MSFT are above them.

Conclusion
I think Meta Platforms and Amazon are showing the most promise for further big moves ahead. Amazon’s development is just so impressive to me, with AWS still growing at 20%, and their new advertising business growing at 23% annually and suddenly bringing in $60 billion in sales annually.
The success in ads is even more impressive when compared to Alphabet, the leading online ad platforms, whose growth is slowing significantly.
Meta Platforms too is just absolutely killing it. Even with its 250% rally in the last year and a half it still trades at a very reasonable earnings multiple. And now with its new $50 billion buyback plan, and a new dividend, it is showing a real commitment to returning cash to shareholders.
Alphabet, although it has some concerning growth data regarding its ad business does continue to chug along. I don’t think it has the best growth prospects, but there is no doubting it is the cheapest of the Magnificent 7, which makes it a worthy investment consideration.
Apple and Microsoft are of course fantastic businesses that should be a part of any well diversified investment portfolio, but I think at this point in time are less appealing than the other three. Apple is seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales growth, and Microsoft seems to have a lot of future news priced in especially regarding its recent gains with AI. The premium valuations are a concern as well.
Nonetheless, this group of the world’s leading companies have shown that even at their mammoth sizes, they continue to thrive. Furthermore, they are showing that the US economy is still performing at a steady rate.

"February 02, 2024 — 03:29 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-unveils-augmented-reality-vision-pro-headset,"(RTTNews) - Apple (AAPL) launched its latest product Vision Pro headset officially on Friday in the U.S. stores.
The augmented reality headset touted as ""the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created"" by CEO Tim Cook, was Apple's first new product in almost seven years.
The headset looks like a designer ski goggles with soft adjustable strap on the top, a digital crown on the back and another one on the top, which also functions as a home button.
According to The New York Times, the Vision Pro headset priced at $3,499 could cost up to $4,600, if additional accessories like $200 travel case, $50 battery pack holder, prescription lens starting at $149, reading lens starting at $99, and more are factored in the original cost.
The headset has a storage capacity of 256 GB. Its battery size is similar to that of an iPhone and provides around 2.5 hours of battery life on a single charge. The speakers are positioned close to the ears to provide rich immersive audio.
The headset ""seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world and unlocks powerful spatial experiences in visionOS, controlled by the most natural and intuitive inputs possible - a user's eyes, hands, and voice,"" Apple said.
On initiating the setup process, the headset would scan the user's eyes, hands and the room. Later, it will lead users to an iOS-like interface, through which they can also activate Siri.
The users can activate the select button to move across the apps by using eye movements, and touching the thumb and pointer finger together on the headset.
Vision Pro offers an ultra-high-resolution display with more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye, enhancing the user's visual experience as the images and videos would appear more life-like.
Speaking about the headset's appstore, Susan Prescott, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations said, ""With more than 600 new spatial experiences to explore in the all-new App Store, alongside more than 1 million compatible apps across iOS and iPadOS, users can discover a wide array of apps that expand the boundaries of what's possible. These incredible apps will change how we experience entertainment, music, and games; spark our imaginations with new ways to learn and explore; unlock productivity like never before; and so much more"".
To reduce motion sickness experienced by users while wearing similar headsets, the tech giant had included a custom chip to cut down the latency issue.
Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst, said that the company had sold an estimated 160,000 to 180,000 Vision Pro headsets during the first pre-order weekend. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that the company will sell around 400,000 Vision Pro units this year.

"February 02, 2024 — 12:05 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-returns-to-revenue-growth%3A-5-etfs-in-focus,"Apple Inc. AAPL reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein it beat estimates on both earnings and revenues. The iPhone manufacturer returned to quarterly sales growth after four straight quarters of declines. However, a decline in China sales pulled down the stock.

Apple shares dropped as much as 3% in after-market hours on China concerns, erasing $84 billion of the company's market valuation. This has put ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan in focus. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).
Apple Earnings in Focus
Earnings per share came in at $2.18, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 and improving 16% year over year. Revenues grew 2% year over year to $119.6 billion and edged past the estimated $117.6 billion. The revenue growth ended the four straight quarters of sales declines and was boosted by iPhone 15 handset sales and services growth (see: all the Technology ETFs here).

iPhone sales grew 6% to $69.7 billion. Services revenues, comprising iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay and Apple Care, rose 11% year over year to an all-time high of $23.1 billion. Revenues from Wearables, Home and Accessories, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV and Beats headphones, declined 11% to $12 billion. Mac sales rose a fraction to $7.8 billion, while iPad sales declined 25% to $7 billion. Apple is still struggling in China, with sales falling 12.9% year over year to $20.8 billion.

The tech giant offered a cautious outlook for the ongoing quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that iPhone sales in the March quarter would be similar to last year’s $51.33 billion in revenues. This excludes $5 billion in sales attributed to outperformance a year ago as supply recovered from COVID-19 shutdowns and caught up to demand.

Product sales (80.7% of sales) were almost flat year over year to $96.46 billion, driven by strong iPhone sales, partially offset by weak iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories revenues.

iPhone sales increased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $69.7 billion and accounted for 58.3% of total sales. iPhone sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.54%. Strong demand for iPhone 15 models drove year-over-year top-line growth.

"February 02, 2024 — 10:46 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-nasdaq-sp-500-climb-on-tech-earnings-cheer-strong-jobs-data-weighs,"By Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian
Feb 2 (Reuters) - The tech-laden Nasdaq and the benchmark S&P 500 rose on Friday as investors cheered robust quarterly reports from Meta Platforms and Amazon.com, while a strong jobs report kept the upbeat sentiment in check.
U.S. job growth accelerated in January and wages increased by the most in nearly two years, signs of persistent strength in the labor market that could make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates in May as currently envisaged by financial markets.
""The strong jobs report indicates that demand in the labor market is higher than expected,"" said Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK.
""While lower interest rates would surely be welcomed, it is becoming increasingly clear that markets and the economy are coping well with the high rate environment, so investors are perhaps feeling that the need for monetary policy to ease is less urgent.""
Boosting sentiment, Meta META.O surged 20.0% to hit a record high and aided a 3.7% surge in the S&P 500 communication services sector .SPLRCL after issuing its first dividend days ahead of Facebook's 20th anniversary, along with a revenue and profit beat on robust advertising sales in the holiday shopping period.
Other social media firms Snap SNAP.N and Pinterest PINS.N rose 4.5% and 2.5%, respectively.
Amazon.com AMZN.O jumped 6.9% following a fourth-quarter revenue beat as new generative AI features in cloud and ecommerce businesses spurred robust growth during the critical holiday period.
Weighing on the blue-chip Dow, Apple AAPL.O lost 1.6% after forecasting a drop in iPhone sales and targeting overall revenue $6 billion below expectations, as its China business took a hit.
Earnings from the tech trio, part of the group of megacap stocks popularly called the ""Magnificent 7"", likely offset some concerns over their rich valuations and outsized weighting in the S&P 500, after Alphabet GOOGL.O and Microsoft's MSFT.O disappointing AI cost projections and Tesla's TSLA.Ogrowth warning.
In the previous session, Wall Street rebounded from a sell-off on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve quashed lingering bets that interest-rate cuts could begin as early as March.
Meanwhile, the KBW Regional Banking index .KRX lost 0.5% hauled by a 5.2% plunge in New York Community Bancorp NYCB.N, its third-day in losses following disappointing earnings that sparked worries on the lenders' exposure to the troubled commercial real estate sector.
The real estate sector .SPLRCR led sectoral declines with a 2.8% fall, while the Russell 2000 small-caps index .RUT declined 1.5%.
At 10:17 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 118.68 points, or 0.31%, at 38,401.16, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 16.95 points, or 0.35%, at 4,923.14, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 130.37 points, or 0.85%, at 15,492.01.
Further on the earnings front, Cigna CI.N rose 5.4% as the health insurer raised its annual profit forecast after lower-than-expected medical costs and strong demand in its pharmacy benefit management unit helped it beat fourth-quarter profit estimates.
Chipmaker Microchip Technology MCHP.O dropped 1.7% after forecasting fourth-quarter net sales below estimates, while footwear maker Skechers U.S.A SKX.N lost 8.4% after a downbeat 2024 forecast.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 4.42-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.68-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 39 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 41 new highs and 86 new lows.

"February 02, 2024 — 10:38 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/markets-today%3A-stocks-higher-on-strong-tech-earnings-despite-hot-payroll-report,"Morning Markets
March E-Mini S&P 500 futures (ESH24) are up +0.31% at a record nearest-futures high, and March Nasdaq 100 E-Mini futures (NQH24) are up +0.67%. 
Stock index futures this morning are moderately higher, boosted by blowout earnings results from Amazon.com and Meta Platforms.  After reporting stellar earnings, Amazon jumped more than +7% in pre-market trading, and Meta Platforms surged more than +17%.  On the negative side, Apple is down more than -2% after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue growth in China.
Stock index futures fell back from their best levels after bond yields shot higher on a stronger-than-expected U.S. Jan unemployment report that showed payrolls rising by the most in a year and wages climbing more than expected.  The report showed a resilient U.S. labor market and pared market expectations for Fed rate cuts. 
U.S. Jan nonfarm payrolls jumped +353,000, much stronger than expectations of +185,000 and the biggest increase in a year.  Also, Dec nonfarm payrolls were revised up sharply to +333,000 from the initially reported +216,000.  The Jan unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7%, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of an increase to 3.8%.
U.S. Jan average hourly earnings rose +0.6% m/m and +4.5% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.3% m/m and +4.1% y/y.
The markets are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 24% at the March 19-20 FOMC meeting and 99% for that -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting April 30-May 1.
U.S. and European government bond yields today are higher.  The 10-year T-note is up +9.8 bp at 3.978%.  The 10-year German bund yield is up +7.6 bp at 2.225%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +12.7 bp at 3.873%.  
Overseas stock markets are mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.38%.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed down -1.46%.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock Index closed up +0.41%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 today is moderately higher on strength in technology stocks on better-than-expected earnings from Amazon.com and Meta Platforms.  Positive earnings news also boosted European stocks, with Danske Bank A/S climbing more than +5% after announcing that it will buy back its shares for the first time since 2018.  Also, Mercedes-Benz Group AG rose more than +3% after reporting better-than-expected cash flow for last year.  On the negative side, Electrolux AG tumbled more than -4% after forecasting a gloomy outlook for the year.
France Dec manufacturing production rose +1.2% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m and the biggest increase in 7 months.
Swaps are pricing in the chances for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at 18% for its next meeting on March 7 and at 89% at the following meeting on April 11.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index retreated to a 3-3/4 year low and closed lower every day this week.  Forced selling of stocks weighed on the overall market as leveraged shareholders who pledged stock as collateral were forced to sell their shares as stock values continued to fall.  According to Bloomberg data, the number of filings announcing a firm’s shareholder is boosting the number of holdings booked as collateral for loans rose to 60 in December, the highest since April of 2022.  Lenders are demanding increased collateral after an extended slump in Chinese stocks, heightening fears that a failure to meet the requirements will force liquidation and lead to more selling.  Recent stimulus and pledges by Chinese authorities to keep up spending this year have proved insufficient to boost confidence in the market. 
Japan’s Nikkei Stock Index today rose to a 1-week high and posted moderate gains.  A rally in technology stocks led the overall market higher today after strong earnings results from Amazon and Meta Platforms.  A decline in government bond yields also supported stocks after the 10-year JGB bond yield fell to a 1-1/2 week low of 0.665%.  Nexon surged the 20% daily limit after Chinese regulators approved the Mobile DnF game the company made in collaboration with Tencent Holdings Ltd. Blomberg Intelligence said the game contributes an estimated 25% of Nexon’s sales, and its launch in China is seen as positive for the company.  On the negative side, Japan’s Aozora Bank sank again today, bringing its two-day slide to 33% after it reported a net loss for the year tied to bad loans on U.S. commercial properties. 
Swaps are pricing in the chances for a +10 bp rate increase by the BOJ at 20% for its next meeting on March 19 and at 78% for the following meeting on April 26.

"FEB 2, 2024 9:32AM EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-earnings-whats-next-for-the-magnificent-seven,"I
t has been a huge week for big tech earnings. After Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported on Tuesday, Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) all revealed their calendar Q4 2023 results after the close yesterday. All five of them recorded beats of expectations in terms of EPS but, for various reasons, the market reactions to their earnings have been mixed. That makes it difficult for those who want to illustrate a theme of some kind in big tech earnings, but it is actually very healthy for all of these stocks, however the market is reacting now.
On the other hand, it may not be good news for market commentators because it could signal the end of a convenient and catchy label, ""The Magnificent Seven.""
Let’s not lose sight of the fact that all five of these massive, widely analyzed companies made more money in Q4 than analysts anticipated. That is obviously a good thing. It is, however, not as big of a deal as you might think if you don’t really understand the way these things work. This quarter is actually below average in that ""only"" around 70% of S&P 500 companies are beating expectations rather than the usual 75% or so.
That such a high percentage of companies beat expectations is kind of ridiculous, but understandable: There seems to be a mutually beneficial, silent agreement between corporations and analysts, whereby CEOs shoot low on their guidance, and analysts accept that as gospel and consistently underestimate earnings as a result. That enables management to underpromise and overdeliver, which is always considered a good idea in business, and avoids analysts being accused of misleading clients by artificially pumping up stocks in which their institutions typically have long positions.
This whole situation has been going on for so long that nobody seems to question it, and I guess it does no harm as long as everyone understands it, but it still seems weird when you stop and think about it.
In any case, beats by big tech firms this quarter have been hard-won and are a little surprising. They have been hard-won because after a year and a half of rate hikes by the Fed and other western central banks, and with the Chinese economy being impacted by a slow developing real estate crisis, this was supposed to be a tough quarter.
And they are surprising because the last three months have been about a market driven by gains in a few big tech stocks, so analysts have been scrambling to revise their estimates for those stocks upwards in order to reflect that market sentiment. If that strikes you as a bit backwards, you are probably right. The market should be led by a rational, dispassionate analysis of a company’s potential profit rather than estimates for that profit being influenced by the views of traders, but history shows that traders usually get these things right, which makes it wise to listen to their collective opinion.
Consistently earning more than upwardly revised estimates suggest indicate that all is well in the world of big tech, political grandstanding, criticism, and regulatory issues notwithstanding. That may irk some people, but they are such a major part of the American economy that, to borrow an old catchphrase, what is good for the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Amazon is good for America, whether you like it or not.
The good news, though, isn’t just about massively wealthy and powerful corporations becoming wealthier and more powerful. It is also about the fact that after three months of lumping all big tech companies together, the differing reactions to these earnings based on differences of outlook suggests that the market is beginning to differentiate and trade based on the actual performance and prospects of each company, rather than on the perception of the group as a whole.
Lumping big tech companies together in named groups began a few years ago when CNBC's Jim Cramer coined the term “FANG” to refer to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. That acronym and its constituent parts changed as companies changed names, along with the emergence of AI technology as the dominant force in earnings potential. Eventually we landed on the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which in addition to the five named above, also includes Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA).
As with all shorthand names for groups of stocks, this one will have a limited shelf life. Other than being well-known, connected to tech, and having posted good gains in their stocks over the last year or so, there is not a lot to link them together. This group is comprised of a car manufacturer, two social media companies, a retailer, a consumer goods company, a software company, and a chip maker. Calling them the Magnificent Seven is fun for financial market talking heads, but it is a bit lazy and misleading.
However, it looks like this earnings season will mark the start of a divergence in performance, perhaps signaling the overdue death of the use of the phrase ""Magnificent Seven"" as investors and traders focus on each company on its own merits, rather than lumping them all together.

Feb 2 (Reuters) - The tech-laden Nasdaq was set for a positive open on Friday as investors cheered robust quarterly reports from Meta Platforms and Amazon.com, while a strong jobs report kept the upbeat sentiment in check.
A Labor Department report showed non-farm payrolls rose by 353,000 in January, sharply higher than the 180,000 expected by economists polled by Reuters.
Unemployment came in at 3.7% in January, lower than the forecast of 3.8%.
""The strong jobs report indicates that demand in the labor market is higher than expected,"" said Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK.
""While lower interest rates would surely be welcomed, it is becoming increasingly clear that markets and the economy are coping well with the high rate environment, so investors are perhaps feeling that the need for monetary policy to ease is less urgent.""
Boosting sentiment, Meta META.O surged 17.2% in premarket trading on issuing its first dividend days ahead of Facebook's 20th anniversary, along with a revenue and profit beat on robust advertising sales in the holiday shopping period.
Other social media firms Snap SNAP.Nand Pinterest PINS.N rose nearly 5% each.
Amazon.com AMZN.O jumped 7.2% following a fourth-quarter revenue beat as new generative AI features in cloud and ecommerce businesses spurred robust growth during the critical holiday period.
""It feels a healthier situation to have the markets driven by strong earnings and corporate success rather than ongoing guesswork about when central banks are going to cut rates,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
On the flip side, Apple AAPL.O lost 3.5% after forecasting a drop in iPhone sales and targeting overall revenue $6 billion below expectations, as its China business took a hit.
Earnings from the tech trio, part of the group of megacap stocks popularly called the ""Magnificent 7"", likely offset some concerns over their rich valuations and outsized weighting in the S&P 500, after Alphabet GOOGL.O and Microsoft's MSFT.O disappointing AI cost projections and Tesla's TSLA.Ogrowth warning.
Nvidia NVDA.O, another member of the group of top-tier stocks, experienced a record-breaking surge in market value in January, driven by heightened artificial intelligence optimism, positive analyst projections, and announcement of expanded AI offerings.
In the previous session, Wall Street rebounded from a sell-off on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve quashed lingering bets that interest-rate cuts could begin as early as March.
At 8:46 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 64 points, or 0.17%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 14.25 points, or 0.29%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 111 points, or 0.64%.
Further on the earnings front, Cigna CI.N rose 2.9% as the health insurer raised its annual profit forecast after lower-than-expected medical costs and strong demand in its pharmacy benefit management unit helped it beat fourth-quarter profit estimates.
Bristol Myers Squibb BMY.N posted upbeat results for the fourth quarter, sending the drugmaker's shares up 1.0%.
Chipmaker Microchip Technology MCHP.O dropped 2.8% after forecasting fourth-quarter net sales below estimates, while footwear maker Skechers U.S.A SKX.N lost 10% after a downbeat 2024 forecast.

"February 02, 2024 — 08:13 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meta-stock-analysis%3A-why-meta-platforms-is-still-a-top-growth-play,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
No Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock analysis would be complete without sharing the company’s big news. Besides stellar financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 it announced its first ever dividend.
META stock is up 14% on news that it will pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of 50 cents a share beginning on March 26 of this year. It’s the first ever dividend payment from Meta Platforms and comes after the company’s cash reserves grew to $65.40 billion at the end of 2023 from $40.70 billion a year earlier. Meta also announced a $50 billion share buyback program.
How the Dividend Affects This META Stock Analysis
The dividend was announced alongside exceptional Q4 2023 results that saw Meta report earnings per share of $5.33 versus $4.96 that had been expected on Wall Street.
Revenue in the quarter came in at $40.10 billion compared to $39.18 billion that was forecast by analysts. The guidance was also better-than-expected, with Meta saying it expects sales in the current first quarter of $34.50 billion to $37 billion, topping estimates of $33.80 billion.
The solid earnings beat and new dividend payment are just the latest signs that Meta Platforms remains a top growth play. META stock is now up more than 300% from a bottom it reached in November 2022.
AI Ambitions
While Meta Platforms might not be the first name that comes to mind when investors think of AI, it is a leading player in the space and has jumped into the realm of artificial intelligence with both feet.
Company CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently wrote on social media: “Our long-term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit.”
Zuckerberg made those comments after Meta Platforms announced its intention to spend billions of dollars this year buying microchips from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) that power its various AI applications.
Estimates are that Meta could spend upwards of $9 billion this year acquiring 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units and 600,000 H100 computer equivalent GPUs. Graphics processing units effectively run the computations needed for AI projects and demand for them is red hot currently.
Meta has also announced plans to make custom-made microchips to power AI on video-processing platforms.
The parent company of social media sites Facebook and WhatsApp has said that its goal is to develop a microchip that can process and deliver four billion videos a day to consumers.
It is also developing AI chips to power the algorithms used to show content and ads in people’s news feeds on Facebook and other social media sites. The company’s also developing chips to train AI models.
Meta has pivoted aggressively to focus on artificial intelligence following the release of chatbots and AI models such as GPT-4.
Meta has even announced that it’s developing a supercomputer called “Research SuperCluster” that can train generative AI platforms and large language learning models.
Advertising Rebound
While AI might be the future at Meta Platforms, online advertising is still the company’s main revenue stream. Like other social media and internet companies, Meta suffered from a drop in online advertising coming out of the pandemic as businesses rationalized their budgets.
But there are signs that a turnaround is underway. In its just released earnings print, Meta said that its revenue rose 25% from a year earlier, the fastest growth rate since mid-2021, as the online ad market continues to recover. 
Specifically, Meta executives said that they are seeing faster growth in the company’s digital ad business following a difficult 2022 when advertising revenue across its social media sites declined for three consecutive quarters.
Expectations are for further ad growth this year, especially with a presidential election campaign underway.
Research firm Insider Intelligence forecasts that political advertising will rise by 30% this year from the previous 2020 presidential election year and reach $12.32 billion. What’s more, digital platforms are expected to see a massive increase of 156% spent on ads run across social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube.
Other Stuff
Beyond its pivot to AI and a recovery in its core digital advertising business, Meta Platforms has several other products to help the company diversify and continue growing throughout 2024 and beyond.
Last fall at its annual developer’s conference, Meta Platforms rolled out a host of new products that got consumers, analysts, and the media excited. These included a new virtual reality headset and several AI-related consumer products.
The Quest 3 virtual reality headset was launched last October in time for the holidays and beat Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) competing headset, the Vision Pro, to market by nearly six months.
Priced at $499, Meta’s Quest 3 headset is much more affordable than Apple’s Vision Pro, which costs $3,500 to buy. Plus, the Quest 3 headset supports video games from Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox unit. Meta also unveiled Ray-Ban mixed reality sunglasses that can capture photos and videos with a voice command.
As for the AI consumer products that Meta Platforms plans to monetize, they include a text-to-image platform called “Emu” that will be integrated with the company’s Messenger app, and an AI photo editing tool for Instagram.
Meta is also launching “AI Studio,” a platform that enables developers to build their own AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. Taken together, the new consumer products should help to drive growth at Meta Platforms as the company continues to diversify.
Buy META Stock
Meta Platforms went through some difficult times in recent years. The company faced criticism for metaverse spending, rebranded, suffered in digital ad business, and experienced a share price decline in 2022.
Meta Platforms has emerged stronger with a new focus on AI, rebounding ad business, and new products. While the share price has run far, there are likely more gains ahead. And now there’s a dividend payment too. META stock is a buy.

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Meta surged 17% in premarket trading on Friday as the Facebook parent's first dividend declaration and robust results increased expectations of strong returns from its investments in ""metaverse"" technologies and artificial intelligence infrastructure.
Days ahead of Facebook's 20th anniversary, Meta META.O authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases and said its quarterly dividend would be 50 cents per share.
The social media giant is the first of its generation of internet juggernauts to issue a dividend, and the fourth from the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, with its yield of 0.51% matching that of Apple AAPL.O, according to LSEG data.
""The returning of cash to shareholders is a bold and well-regarded move. The amount of free cash pumping through the business means it is more than able to afford it, and it helps pay investors for their patience,"" Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.
The new dividend plan would also mean a hefty payout for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who owns about 350 million Meta Class A and Class B shares. The Facebook co-founder could get about $175 million every quarter.
""Meta's strategy of announcing buybacks and dividends right before the Fed begins to cut rates is a brilliant move. As the battle for innovation grows ... in the Big Tech space, investors will see any extra capital as dry powder for future earnings growth,"" said Thomas Monteiro, analyst at Investing.com.
The company flagged strong ad sales and a rebound in user growth during its fourth-quarter results on Thursday, while also forecasting current-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates.
""Revenue growth and guidance likely put to rest the biggest hang-up of owning Meta ... but we were more impressed with the long-term vision laid out,"" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said.
Meta has been working at keeping costs low during the last year, and let go of more than 21,000 employees since late 2022, with Zuckerberg calling 2023 the ""Year of Efficiency"".
The world's biggest social media company has been spending billions of dollars over the past decade to boost its computing capacity for generative AI products it is adding to Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, and to hardware devices such as its Ray-Ban smart glasses.
Meta's shares trade at 21.29 times expected earnings, compared with a forward PE of 83.85 for social media rival Snap SNAP.N, 20.38 for Alphabet GOOGL.O, 40.51 for Amazon.com AMZN.O, 31.57 for Microsoft MSFT.O and 27.36 for Apple.
Meta was on track to gain roughly $173 billion in market value, based on a premarket share price of $462.08, if gains hold.
""The 'Year of Efficiency' has paid off, with both headcount and costs dropping, and Meta exceeding our expectations for full-year 2023 ad revenue,"" Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, said.

"February 02, 2024 — 06:25 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apples-china-sales-tumble-highlights-waning-clout-as-local-brands-gain,"By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh
BEIJING, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Apple's AAPL.O weak China sales performance may have shocked investors, but customers and analysts have been noting the rising challenges the company faces in its third-largest market.
Intensifying competition from domestic rivals, coupled with longer upgrade cycles as consumers spend more cautiously amid an economic slowdown, have stunted Apple's China growth, with sales there by 13% in the quarter ending in December to $20.8 billion and missing estimates of $23.5 billion.
Shares of the company dipped about 3% in premarket trading on Friday, following the disappointing China sales.
""Apple's sales decline in China is not surprising given the strong competition it faced from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi,"" said Toby Zhu, an analyst with research group Canalys.
As the world's largest smartphone market, China is crucial to Apple's sales growth. For years, Apple has been the premium phone brand of choice in the country but the tide is now turning.
The pressure on Apple intensified in the second half of the year after Huawei's comeback in the high-end smartphone market with its Mate 60 series phones powered by a domestically-made chip.
Other leading Android brands like Xiaomi 1810.HK also edged into the high-end turf that Apple has traditionally dominated. Xiaomi launched its premium Mi 14 model in October, touting its long battery life and camera capabilities. It sold 1 million units within a week of launch.
Canalys' Zhu said Chinese manufacturers are gradually breaking into Apple's core price segment by introducing higher-priced foldable products.
Chinese consumers have also complained about a lack of innovation in Apple's iPhones, particularly in the design aesthetic, compared to earlier iterations.
""Another hurdle Apple needs to overcome is how it could bring more wow factors to the buyers and sustain its image as a tech pioneer. This is especially crucial when other Android vendors are now bringing foldables and AI to their products,"" said Will Wong, an smartphone analyst with IDC.
At the same time, Chinese customers are holding on to handsets for longer because of the economic slowdown. Consultancy Counterpoint said in June that the replacement cycle was over 40 months.
To support its Chinese sales, Apple has cut prices. A massive discounting campaign by online retailers including Alibaba and Pinduoduo in October to clear iPhone 15 stock, just a month after it was launched in the country. In January, Apple offered rare discounts on its iPhones.
The October discounting effort seemed to only stem the decline, with Apple's phone shipments dropping by just 2.1% in the final quarter of 2023, while Huawei's sales increased by 36.2%, according to data from research group IDC.
Apple will likely continue to face pressure in China going forward. Jefferies analysts predict Apple's shipments in China will decline by a double digit percentage in 2024.
""The big miss in China is concerning as it could be the start of a longer downward trend there"", said Bob O'Donnell at TECHnalysis Research.

"February 02, 2024 — 06:17 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meta-shares-jump-after-first-ever-dividend-plan-year-of-efficiency-pays-off,"Feb 2 (Reuters) - Meta surged 17% in premarket trading on Friday as the Facebook parent's first dividend declaration and robust results increased expectations of strong returns from its investments in ""metaverse"" technologies and artificial intelligence infrastructure.
Days ahead of Facebook's 20th anniversary, Meta META.O authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases and said its quarterly dividend would be 50 cents per share.
The dividend would not change the total amount of capital returned and introducing a dividend gives the company more ""flexibility,"" Meta CFO Susan Li said.
The new dividend plan would also mean a hefty payout for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who owns about 350 million Meta Class A and Class B shares. The Facebook co-founder could get about $175 million every quarter.
""The returning of cash to shareholders is a bold and well-regarded move. The amount of free cash pumping through the business means it is more than able to afford it, and it helps pay investors for their patience,"" Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.
Meta on Thursday flagged strong ad sales and a rebound in user growth during its fourth-quarter results, while the social media giant also forecast current-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates.
The company has been working at keeping costs low during the last year, and let go of more than 21,000 employees since late 2022, with Zuckerberg calling 2023 the ""Year of Efficiency"".
""We are impressed with strong results/guidance and overall resiliency of Meta's advertising platform given macro wobbles, although this reflects the meaningful investments in platform engineering and product development,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said.
The world's biggest social media company has been spending billions of dollars over the past decade to boost its computing capacity for generative AI products it is adding to Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, and to hardware devices such as its Ray-Ban smart glasses.
Meta's shares trade at 21.29 times expected earnings, compared with a forward PE of 83.85 for social media rival Snap SNAP.N, 20.38 for Alphabet GOOGL.O, 40.51 for Amazon.com AMZN.O and 31.57 for Microsoft MSFT.O, according to LSEG data.
Meta is the fourth from the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks to pay a dividend, with its yield of 0.51% matching that of Apple AAPL.O.
Meta was on track to gain $171 billion in market value, based on a premarket share price of $461.30, if gains hold.
""The 'Year of Efficiency' has paid off, with both headcount and costs dropping, and Meta exceeding our expectations for full-year 2023 ad revenue,"" Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, said.

"February 02, 2024 — 06:17 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-nasdaq-futures-jump-on-tech-earnings-cheer-ahead-of-jobs-data,"For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE/ or type LIVE/ in a news window.
Futures: Dow flat, S&P up 0.54%, Nasdaq up 1.01%
Feb 2 (Reuters) - Nasdaq futures climbed 1% on Friday as investors cheered strong quarterly reports from Meta Platforms and Amazon.com and keenly awaited a crucial jobs print at the end of a week marked by major tech earnings and a U.S. policy decision.
Meta META.O surged 16.8% in premarket trading on issuing its first dividend days ahead of Facebook's 20th anniversary, along with a revenue and profit beat on robust advertising sales in the holiday shopping period.
Amazon.com AMZN.O jumped 6.1% following a fourth-quarter revenue beat as new generative AI features in cloud and ecommerce businesses spurred robust growth during the critical holiday period.
""While the scorecard for the Magnificent Seven in the current earnings season to date is mixed, Amazon and Meta certainly produced stand-out quarterly updates,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
""It feels a healthier situation to have the markets driven by strong earnings and corporate success rather than ongoing guesswork about when central banks are going to cut rates.""
On the flip side, Apple AAPL.O lost 2.6% after forecasting a drop in iPhone sales and targeting overall revenue $6 billion below expectations, as its China business took a hit.
Earnings from the tech trio, part of the group of megacap stocks popularly called the ""Magnificent 7"", likely offset some concerns over their rich valuations and outsized weighting in the S&P 500, after Alphabet GOOGL.O and Microsoft's MSFT.O disappointing AI cost projections and Tesla's TSLA.Ogrowth warning.
Nvidia NVDA.O, another member of the group of top-tier stocks, experienced a record-breaking surge in market value in January, driven by heightened artificial intelligence optimism, positive analyst projections, and announcement of expanded AI offerings.
Chevron CVX.N, Exxon Mobil XOM.N, Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY.N, AbbVie ABBV.N, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O and Cigna Group CI.N are some of the high-profile earnings due before market open.
The much-anticipated non-farms payroll report for January, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, will shed further light on the strength of the U.S. labor market following a series of mixed jobs data throughout the week.
In the previous session, Wall Street rebounded from a sell-off on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve quashed lingering bets that interest-rate cuts could begin as early as March.
At 5:26 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 1 points, or 0%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 26.75 points, or 0.54%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 175.75 points, or 1.01%.
Further on the earnings front, chipmaker Microchip Technology MCHP.O dropped 3.1% after forecasting fourth-quarter net sales below estimates, while footwear maker Skechers U.S.A SKX.N lost 11.3% after a downbeat 2024 forecast.
New York Community Bank NYCB.N gained some lost ground, rising 2.6% after sliding nearly 45% over the past two day, jolting concerns over the state of U.S. regional banks after ruptures last year.

"February 02, 2024 — 06:04 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dont-invest-in-rivian-if-you-cant-answer-these-3-questions,"Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) has emerged as a strong candidate to move from a young electric vehicle (EV) start-up to a significant player. While the stock has trended lower as EV sales growth has slowed in the U.S., the company is still an intriguing long-term play you can scoop up on the cheap right now.
But before you dive in, make sure you understand and can answer these three questions.
1. Will Amazon hold Rivian back?
At first glance, this question might seem odd. After all, Amazon's order for a total of 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2030 is a huge positive for the company, even if many investors were disappointed to learn that as of October, it had only delivered about 10,000.
However, what many investors overlook is that Amazon is also a significant holder of Rivian stock. In fact, Amazon owns a 17% stake in the young EV maker. On one hand, that's good news because what's good for Rivian is also good for Amazon. On the other hand, if Amazon were to decide to cash out its stake in Rivian, it would create an overhang on the stock that could last for many months.
It wouldn't be the first time Rivian has dealt with a situation like this. Ford Motor Company had originally planned to develop a platform in partnership with Rivian, but eventually walked away and slowly sold off its stake in the EV maker. (Ford would later use the profits from that sale to dish out a special dividend to its investors.)
Rivian's partnership with Amazon is a huge positive for the company, but be aware: If Amazon ever decides to sell its stake, that could depress Rivian's stock price for months.
2. Will Rivian reach gross profitability soon?
One big milestone that Rivian is approaching is becoming gross profit positive. Management estimates that it'll happen in 2024 -- if and when it does, that will go a long way toward convincing investors to jump on board, and show that the company should eventually become profitable enough to fund its operations without taking on more debt or diluting shareholders through the issuance of additional shares.
To reach positive gross profit in 2024, the company will have to significantly ramp up its production and deliveries -- perhaps even double them from 2023 levels. Will it be able to do those things in 2024?
Chart by author. Data source: Rivian production and delivery releases.
As you can see, there was a slight weakness in fourth-quarter deliveries that was largely blamed on Amazon not accepting large shipments of delivery vans during the peak holiday season -- which is understandable.
But for the company to become gross profit positive, growth must resume in production and deliveries in the first quarter and beyond.
3. What will Rivian's home run moment be -- and when might it come?
With any young company, investors are looking for a home run moment or catalyst that could spark a surge in the stock price. Rivian absolutely is closing in on one such moment: The day that its second factory opens up for commercial production in Georgia and begins rolling out the Rivian R2. Those SUVs are expected to be priced between $40,000 and $50,000, which will open the door for more mainstream consumers to consider Rivian. Investors can expect this home run moment sometime in 2026 -- unless the construction and ramp-up hit speed bumps that push the timeline back.
Rivian also recently made an intriguing hire that it considers a big win: DJ Novotney, an Apple veteran (and vice president of hardware engineering) who was a notable participant in the development of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, among other devices.
Novotney's hiring comes at a perfect time, and as the new head of product management for products and engineering, it's not a stretch to imagine that he will have a chance to put his fingerprints on the R2. That idea should excite investors.
Questions answered
Rivian has entered 2024 with momentum, and the company is doing many things right. If investors understand the potential risks inherent in Amazon's large stake, can keep an eye on the company's production and deliveries as it climbs toward gross profitability, and have the patience to wait for the catalyst of R2 vehicles hitting the market, there could be much upside to be had from Rivian stock over the long term as the trend of mass adoption of EVs slowly gains traction in the U.S. market.

"February 02, 2024 — 06:00 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffett-owns-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-but-should-you,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who leads Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B)(NYSE: BRK.A), has made an artificial intelligence company the largest holding in Berkshire's $371 billion portfolio. Ironically, that may not have been his intention when he first purchased the stock in early 2016.
Warren Buffett has long been a fan of iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). He's repeatedly praised the company for its strong brand power. Loyal iPhone users continually buy new phones, creating billions of dollars in profit that trickle back to Buffett via dividends and share repurchases.
Today, Apple is using artificial intelligence (AI) to strengthen its core business, and its stock has appreciated considerably over the past eight years.
Should investors still buy and hold the stock, or did Buffett beat investors to the punch?
Here is what you need to know.
AI is infiltrating Apple's business
For some companies, AI is apparent. But not so much for Apple. The company still makes most of its money by selling iPhones and other hardware and service subscriptions for music, news, gaming, and more. But rest assured, Apple is implementing AI throughout the iOS experience.
For example, Apple uses AI to accurately scan your face and verify your identity when using Face ID. Open up your photo gallery, and AI features will automatically prepare collages and short films or let you edit and enhance photos. Your iOS keyboard will learn from your input, predicting words you might use and autocorrecting when you make mistakes.
Ultimately, Apple is using AI to improve the user experience on iOS. You could already argue that iOS is wonderfully sticky. After all, who wants to move all their apps, passwords, media, etc., to a new smartphone brand? With Apple, it backs up to the cloud and automatically loads up on a new iPhone like it never left. But continual improvements and features make you increasingly likely to keep returning to upgrade your devices.
Buffett might not have thought to buy Apple because of AI. Instead, the company's fantastic product and brand power probably caught his eye. However, AI is instrumental to Apple continually improving its products and brand power. That's the key.
Buffett did get into the stock early
Whether by luck, intuition, or skill, Buffett has proven very opportunistic throughout his career. His Apple investment might be the best example of this. Berkshire began buying Apple in early 2016. As you can see, the stock traded at its lowest price-to-earnings ratio at the time, just 10 times its earnings:
AAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts
Apple has since grown into a much larger business. The stock has returned roughly 700% since the beginning of 2016, a combination of growth and a stock valuation that's steadily risen over the past eight years.
Today, Apple trades at a much higher P/E ratio, over 31 times earnings.
Should investors today own Apple?
Whether investors should buy and hold Apple boils down to two questions. First, is Apple still a fantastic business? I think it's evident that it is. There are over 2 billion active iOS devices today, and Apple has generated just under $100 billion in free cash flow over the past four quarters. That's more cash profit than most companies produce in revenue.
That could explain why Apple has grown to represent roughly half of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.
The other question is whether buying the stock makes sense at its current price. That's a more challenging question because Apple is far more expensive than it was in 2016. It's also harder to grow when you reach such a massive size. Analysts believe Apple's earnings will compound at almost 10% annually over time, which makes its P/E ratio a steep price for that growth.
If you're like Buffett and already own the stock, it's probably safe to retain those shares and count on holding for years to come. Some companies are so good that you shouldn't overthink it -- own the stock. But it's tough to pull the lever at these prices for those on the outside looking in. Consider waiting for a better buying opportunity, or buy a little now and slowly dollar-cost average into an investment.

"February 02, 2024 — 05:30 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-how-much-apple-stock-gained-in-each-year-since-the-iphone-launched-in-2007,"Seventeen years have elapsed since Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced the first iPhone on Jan. 9, 2007, a breakthrough product that gave rise to the smartphone industry. The stock has been a phenomenal investment since that momentous event. Specifically, it returned a total of 7,390% over the last 17 years, compounding at 28.7% annually. That means an initial investment of $15,000 in January 2007 would now be worth $1.1 million.
Is Apple still a smart investment today?
Apple has been a consistent innovator throughout its history
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in 1976 and the Apple I computer debuted that same year. But it was the Apple II in 1977 that positioned the start-up company as an early leader in personal computers. Apple used that success to tap the public markets in 1980, raising $100 million during its highly anticipated initial public offering. That momentum carried Apple into the Fortune 500 by 1983.
The next chapter was less upbeat. Jobs was effectively fired in 1985 and Apple floundered after his departure. The once-promising computer company fell behind competitors like Microsoft and IBM, and its financial performance gradually deteriorated. In fact, Apple was on the brink of bankruptcy when the company reinstalled Jobs as CEO in 1997. His homecoming sparked a wave of innovation that put Apple back on the map.
Most notably, the company introduced the first iMac in 1998, the first iPod in 2001, and the first iPhone in 2007. That cemented its position as a premier consumer electronics brand, but Apple has continued to bring trendy devices to market ever since. Its hardware portfolio now includes MacBooks, iPads, AirPods, and Apple Watches, among other products and services.
Shareholders have benefited greatly from the company's capacity for innovation. The chart below shows how much Apple stock returned in each year since the iPhone launched in 2007, assuming all dividends were reinvested.
Chart by author. Shown above is the total annual return for Apple stock in each year since the iPhone was announced in 2007.
Apple is a consumer electronics leader, but services are key to future growth
Apple cultivated substantial brand authority due to its capacity for innovation, but the company has a truly durable economic moat because of its proprietary software. Specifically, its closed-source iOS operating system gives the company complete control over all aspects of the iPhone experience. It also means third-party manufacturers cannot run iOS on cheaper devices to create Apple-like products. Consumers who want the Apple experience have to pay for it -- and they do.
Apple derives a great deal of pricing power from its brand authority and proprietary software. For instance, the average iPhone costs nearly four times more than the average Android phone. That ability to command premium prices is important, but Apple must also grow its services business for the stock to be a worthwhile investment.
Apple has a strong presence in many consumer electronics verticals. It ranks second in smartphones, fourth in personal computers, first in digital tablets, and first in smartwatches. In total, Apple's installed base exceeds 2 billion active devices. But consumers buy hardware infrequently, so the company must monetize users with adjacencies like App Store downloads, iCloud storage, Apple Pay, and subscription products like Apple Music and Apple TV+.
Apple has a sizable footprint in several of those service categories. Most notably, it dominates the mobile application market, and it monetizes its leadership in two ways: transaction fees and advertising. Apple's App Store earns twice as much revenue as Alphabet's Google Play Store, and Apple is one of the fastest-growing advertising companies in the world.
Meanwhile, Apple has positioned itself as ""the most formidable big tech player in payments,"" according to MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis. Apple Pay is the most popular in-store mobile wallet among U.S. consumers, with nearly three times more market share that its closest competitor.
Apple stock trades at an expensive valuation compared to growth prospects
Apple reported disappointing financial results in fiscal 2023. Total revenue fell 3% to $383.3 billion as high inflation suppressed consumer spending. Sales declined across every business segment except services. However, the company repurchased enough stock during the year to offset top-line weakness. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income was essentially flat at $6.13 per diluted share.
The chart below details revenue (and revenue growth) across all five business segments in fiscal 2023, which ended on Sept. 30, 2023.
Chart by author. Shown above is the revenue across all five Apple business segments in fiscal 2023, which ended on Sept. 30, 2023.
Going forward, Wall Street expects Apple to grow earnings per share at 8.6% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 31.3 times earnings look quite expensive, especially when the five-year average is 26.5 times earnings.
Apple is an excellent business, but I doubt the stock can deliver market-beating returns from its current valuation. For that reason, I would personally wait for a cheaper entry point before buying Apple stock. But famous investor Warren Buffett might disagree.

"February 02, 2024 — 04:57 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/global-markets-china-stocks-slump-but-world-markets-hold-firm-as-us-payrolls-loom,"By Stella Qiu and Dhara Ranasinghe
SYDNEY/LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - China shares fell to new five-year lows on Friday and posted their worst weekly drop in five years, while bumper earnings at Amazon and Meta helped buoy world stocks ahead of key U.S. jobs data later in the day.
The Shanghai Composite .SSEC closed 1.5% lower with investors disappointed by cautious and piecemeal government stimulus measures to shore up the shaky economy.
For the week, the index sank 6.2%, its largest such loss since October 2018. The blue-chip CSI300 .CSI300 hit a five-year low, while shares in drug research and development group WuXi AppTec 603259.SS slid 20% in Hong Kong after its mention in a U.S. bill aimed at restricting access to Americans' genetic data revived geopolitical concerns.
""The tension between the U.S. and China seems not dissipating,"" said Saxo's chief China strategist, Redmond Wong.
Investors are also growing impatient at the lack of big-ticket stimulus to shore up demand and confidence, Wong said.
Still, China pain and renewed U.S. regional bank worries, failed to put a significant dent in world stock markets with investors taking comfort from upbeat earnings.
European shares were broadly firmer .STOXX, while U.S. stock futures pointed to a strong open on Wall Street ESc1.
Quarterly results from Meta PlatformsMETA.O and Amazon.comAMZN.O impressed investors, with their shares surging 15% and 7% in after-hours trading, respectively, adding a combined $280 billion in stock market value. Apple AAPL.O, however, fell 3% after the close on disappointing China sales.
In Europe, Danske Bank DANSKE.CO jumped over 6% after the Danish lender reported fourth-quarter results and announced a share buyback program, while carmaker Mercedes-Benz MBGn.DE rallied after an upbeat update.
In Tokyo, Japan's Aozora Bank 8304.T however slumped for a second straight session after provisioning for U.S. office loan losses.
Concerns about the health of regional U.S. lenders have resurfaced after New York Community Bancorp NYCB.N this week reported increased stress in its commercial real estate portfolio.
HERE COME PAYROLLS
After early action, focus across world markets turns to the release of the January U.S. jobs report at 1330 GMT.
Economists polled by Reuters estimated the U.S. economy added 180,000 new jobs last month after creating 216,000 in December.
The data could further dampen market expectations of an interest rate cut in March, with annual wage growth forecast to have maintained its solid pace last month.
The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday signalled that rates would move lower this year but pushed back against expectations for an imminent rate cut.
Reflecting the still sizeable cuts expected to come this year - about 145 bps are priced in - and renewed jitters over regional U.S. banks adding to safe-haven demand, longer-term Treasuries are headed for the best week since mid December.
Ten-year Treasury yields US10YT=RR were 3 basis points higher in London trade at around 3.89%, but are still down a whopping 27 bps for the week.
The rate sensitive two-year yield US2YT=RR was up 4 bps at 4.23%, but down 15 bps on the week.
This week's slide in bond yields kept the dollar on the back foot. The dollar index was a slightly lower on the day and on track for its first weekly decline of the year =USD.
""Despite the Federal Reserve pushing back against prospects of a March cut, interest rates have still come lower. That may be a function of investors watching U.S. regional banks remain under pressure,"" said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING.
""Or more likely it reflects a conviction call that policy rates are coming lower this year and there is no point fighting this overwhelming trend. This is the reason that the dollar did not build on gains seen early yesterday.""
The euro EUR=EBS was a touch firmer at $1.0880, while sterling GBP=D3 was perched at $1.2749, having rallied 0.5% after the Bank of England said on Thursday it would tread carefully about rate cuts.
In energy markets, oil prices recouped some losses from the previous day following a decision by OPEC+ to keep its oil output policy unchanged, though they are still headed for weekly losses. O/R
Brent crude futures LCOc1 were flat at around $78.68 a barrel, after falling more than 2% the previous day, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 a touch softer at $73.74 a barrel.

SYDNEY, Feb 2 (Reuters) - China shares fell to fresh five-year lows on Friday and posted their worst weekly drop in five years despite late-session signs of state support, while blowout earnings at Amazon and Meta buoyed European and U.S. futures ahead of labour-market data.
The Shanghai Composite .SSEC closed 1.5% lower as investors remain disappointed by cautious and piecemeal government stimulus measures to shore up the shaky economy.
For the week, the index sank 6.2%, its largest such loss since October 2018. The blue-chip CSI300 .CSI300 fell 1.2% to 3,179 - breaching the closely watched 3,200-level and hitting a five-year low in the afternoon. .SS
Shares in drug research and development group WuXi AppTec 603259.SS went limit down in Shanghai and dropped 20% in Hong Kong as its mention in a U.S. bill aimed at restricting access to Americans' genetic data again raised geopolitical concerns.
""The tension between the U.S. and China seems not dissipating,"" said Saxo's chief China strategist, Redmond Wong, while investors are also growing impatient at the lack of big-ticket stimulus to shore up demand and confidence.
Dealers noted late surges in volume on exchange-traded funds tracking the CSI300, which suggest ""national team"" or state-backed buying. But it only lifted markets from lows rather than shaking the negative mood that has deepened in recent weeks.
""(It) didn't hold,"" said Wong Kok Hoong, head of equity sales trading at Maybank. ""I think Hong Kong will continue to slide 'til close too.""
Elsewhere the Nikkei .N225 rose 0.4% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng .HSI was flat.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 1.2% largely thanks to a 2.9% surge in South Korea .KS11 where automaker shares were flying on chatter of a government push to nudge up undervalued stocks. .KS
Quarterly results from Meta PlatformsMETA.O and Amazon.comAMZN.O impressed U.S. investors, with their shares surging 15% and 7% in after-hour trading, respectively, adding a combined $280 billion in stock market value. Apple AAPL.O, however, fell 3% after the close on disappointing China sales.
The tech rally looked set to spill over to European markets, with EUROSTOXX 50 futures STXEc1 up 0.8%. Nasdaq 100 futures NQc1 extended gains to be up 1% while S&P 500 futures ESc1 rose 0.6%.
TREASURIES RALLY
China's slump and the tech rally has temporarily drawn attention away from pressureon U.S. regional bank stocks, though Aozora Bank 8304.T slumped for a second straight session after provisioning for U.S. office loan losses.
Concerns about the health of regional lenders had resurfaced after New York Community Bancorp NYCB.N reported increased stress in its commercial real estate portfolio.
Investors are now waiting for U.S. payrolls data on Friday. Economists expect the U.S. economy added 180,000 new jobs in January, which would be a slowdown from December and perhaps begin to make a case for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts sooner rather than later.
""Although ... Fed Chair Powell didn't think a March rate cut was likely, ultimately ... the data will determine the case for when the Fed should start easing,"" said National Australia Bank currency strategist Rodrigo Catril.
Weaker payroll data could bring a March rate cut back into play. Markets still see a chance of a March move at about 40%, while pricing 32 basis points (bps) of cuts for May - implying a 100% probability of 25 bps and some chance of a 50 bp easing. FEDWATCH
Ten-year treasury yields US10YT=RR rose 2 bps to 3.887%, but were still down a whopping 27 basis points for the week. The rate sensitive two-years US2YT=RR were also up 2 bps at 4.2186%, but down 15 bps on the week.
The slide in yields pressured the U.S. dollar, which fell 0.5% overnight against its peers =USD and on Friday stuck to the low end of its recent range at 103.03.
The euro EUR=EBS was buoyant at $1.0877, having firmed 0.5% overnight after data showed underlying price pressures in the euro zone were still strong.
Sterling GBP=D3was perched at $1.2745, having rallied 0.5% overnight after the Bank of England said it would tread carefully about rate cuts.
In energy markets, oil prices recouped some losses from the previous day following a decision by OPEC+ to keep its oil output policy unchanged, though they are still headed for weekly losses. O/R
Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose 0.6% to $79.15 a barrel, after falling more than 2% the previous day, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 gained 0.5% to $74.2 a barrel.

"February 02, 2024 — 01:55 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-sets-monthly-record-with-unprecedented-market-value-surge-in-january,"Feb 2 (Reuters) - NVIDIA Corp NVDA.OQ experienced a record-breaking surge in market value in January, the largest monthly increase ever, driven by heightened optimism around artificial intelligence (AI), positive analyst projections, and the company's announcement of expanded AI offerings.
The world's most valuable chipmaker saw its market value expand by an unprecedented $296.52 billion to about $1.52 trillion, surpassing its previous high of $248.23 billion in gains seen in May 2023.
Last month, Nvidia's stock climbed to new heights following the announcement of new desktop graphics processors and advancements in AI-related components and software.
Meanwhile, Microsoft MSFT.O, the world's most valuable company, also enjoyed a robust increase in market value, adding $159.36 billion, largely attributed to the rising demand for its Azure cloud service.
The tech giant on Tuesday, reported higher than estimated quarterly profit and revenue, although investors turned cautious about its rising costs that are expected to ""increase materially"" on a sequential basis.
As of Wednesday, Microsoft's market value stood at $2.95 trillion, outstripping Apple Inc's AAPL.OQ $2.85 trillion in market capital.
Meanwhile, Meta Platforms META.O saw a strengthening in its market value last month, crossing back over the $1 trillion mark for the first time since September 2021.
Meta's stock surged over 14% to a record high $451 after the bell on Thursday, elevating its market capitalization by $148 billion to $1.16 trillion after the Facebook owner delivered a 25% jump in revenue to $40.1 billion for the December quarter and declared its first-ever dividend.
On the other end of the spectrum, Tesla Inc TSLA.OQ emerged as the weakest performer among the top 20 global companies by market cap, losing about 24.5% of its value over the last month due to concerns over slowing growth. CEO Elon Musk has cautioned that sales growth would be ""notably lower"" this year despite recent price reductions.
Additonally, Saudi Arabian Oil Co 2222.SE saw a 7.3% fall in its market value.

SYDNEY, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Asian shares were buoyed by a late bounce in U.S. tech on Friday as results from Meta and Amazon beat expectations, while investors are bracing for U.S. jobs figures, which could hasten bets for rate cuts if they come in below forecast.
Both quarterly results from Meta PlatformsMETA.O and Amazon.comAMZN.O impressed investors, with their shares surging 15% and 7% in after-hour trading, respectively, adding a combined $280 billion in stock market value on Thursday. Apple AAPL.O, however, fell 3% after the close on disappointing China sales.
The risk rally is set to spill over to European markets, with EUROSTOXX 50 futures MSTXEc1 up 0.9%. S&P 500 futures ESc1 extended gains to be up 1% while S&P 500 futures ESc1 rose 0.5%.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei .N225 added 0.5%, bringing the weekly gain to 1.2%, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS jumped 1.2% and was up 0.7% on the week.
However, weak China sentiment again weighed on the local markets. China's bluechips .CSI300 fell 0.7%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index .HSI pared earlier gains to be up just 0.3%. .SS
Concerns about the health of regional lenders resurfaced after New York Community Bancorp NYCB.N reported increased stress in its commercial real estate portfolio.
""It does provide another bit of a headwind for sentiment within the equity market. But for the Fed, I think that at this stage it's not yet a concern that will tilt them or force them into some policy action,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank.
For now, investors are mostly waiting for U.S. payrolls data on Friday. Economists expect the U.S. economy added 180,000 new jobs in January, while the jobless rate ticked up to 3.8% from 3.7%.
That would come after a surprise jump in jobless claims and a weak private payrolls report.
""If you look at the distributions of the survey, it actually has a significantly wide distribution, so there's a greater degree of uncertainty in terms of the outcome,"" said Catril from NAB.
""Although yesterday Fed Chair Powell didn't think a March rate cut was likely, ultimately...the data will determine the case for when the Fed should start easing.""
Ten-year treasury yields US10YT=RR rose 2 basis points to 3.887%, but were still down a whopping 27 basis points for the week. The rate sensitive two-years US2YT=RR were also up 2 bps at 4.2186%, but down 15 bps on the week.

"February 02, 2024 — 12:48 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-stellar-earnings-meta-looks-like-a-growth-and-income-stock,"The technology and social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) posted robust Q4 earnings. The company witnessed rapid growth in its revenue and earnings, along with increased user engagement. Further, the company declared its first dividend payout during the Q4 conference call. Given stellar earnings, Meta has successfully positioned itself as a growth and income stock.
Before we dig deeper, it’s worth highlighting that Meta stock appreciated over 109% in one year. Further, it gained over 15% in Thursday's after-hours trading. 
Meta’s Growth Accelerates   
The graph below shows that Meta’s revenue, operating margin, and EPS growth accelerated sequentially. Its ability to drive higher engagement led by reels and video, incorporation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in its products, and focus on lowering costs led to a solid recovery in its revenue and profitability. 
What stands out is that Meta’s year-over-year top-line growth rate accelerated from about 3% in Q1 of 2023 to approximately 25% in Q4. Further, its operating margin expanded from 25% in Q1 to 41% in Q4. Thanks to the higher sales and lower operating costs, Meta’s EPS marked a substantial recovery, from witnessing a decline of 19% in Q1 to growing by 203% in Q4. 
Meta is Now an Income Stock
Thanks to its strong growth and expanding earnings base, Meta continues to invest in the business and focuses on returning capital to its shareholders. While the company has historically returned cash in the form of share repurchases, it surprisingly announced its first dividend payout during the Q4 conference call. 
Meta announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share, payable on March 26, 2024, to stockholders of record as of February 22, 2024. 
What is the Prediction for Meta Stock?
Wall Street analysts are bullish about Meta stock’s prospects. However, analysts' average price target suggests a limited upside potential due to the rally in its share price over the past year. 
It's worth noting that most of the price targets were set before the Q4 earnings report. This raises the possibility that META stock might witness upward adjustments in price targets from analysts due to aggressive investments in AI, promising growth prospects, enhanced revenue and profitability, and the initiation of dividend payments.
With 27 Buys and two Holds, Meta stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating. Analysts’ average price target of $426.11 implies 7.94% upside potential from current levels. 
Bottom Line 
Meta’s investments in AI to drive user engagement and ad sales augur well for growth. Moreover, the company's emphasis on optimizing operational efficiency is expected to cushion its margins and EPS, potentially supporting its share price. This is reflected in analysts’ bullish outlook on META stock.

"February 01, 2024 — 07:24 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-going-on-with-meta-and-apple-shares,"Earnings season is always an exciting time to be an investor, as companies finally pull the curtain back and unveil what’s transpired behind the scenes. The 2023 Q4 cycle looks to be another critical period, particularly as investors look to find further clues about what lies ahead in 2024 overall.
One company in particular, Meta Platforms META, saw its shares melt higher post-earnings, with investors swarming. On the contrary, Apple AAPL shares faced selling pressure. Let’s take a closer look at the releases.
Meta Q4
Meta has consistently posted robust earnings results lately, regularly exceeding our expectations and enjoying buying pressure following the releases. Concerning the report in focus, the technology titan generated $40.1 billion in sales, improving by a sizable 25% from the year-ago period.
Top line results reflect a considerable acceleration, with the 25% jump penciling in the highest year-over-year growth rate in eight quarters.
Undoubtedly to the likes of investors, Q4 costs and expenses fell 8% compared to the same period last year, and the company purchased over $6 billion in shares throughout the period. META’s improved operations have clearly led to significant benefits, with quarterly EPS of $5.33 well above the year-ago mark and easily surpassing the $4.83 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate. Impressively, the company’s operating margin came in at 41%, crushing the year-ago figure of 20%.
The company’s platform also continues to expand, with Facebook daily and monthly active users growing by 6% and 3%, respectively. And its advertising business remains sound, with ad impressions delivered across its family of apps improving 21% year-over-year.
META has consistently posted better-than-expected advertising revenue.

And to top off the robust results, the company unveiled its first-ever dividend, which is payable on March 26th to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22nd. Mark Zuckerberg on the results - ‘We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow. We've made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.’
Apple Q1
Concerning headline figures, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, climbing 2% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.18, up 16% from the year-ago mark and reflecting a record. Apple shares didn’t experience the same positivity as META, facing selling pressure post-earnings. It’s worth noting that the results snapped a four-quarter long streak of negative year-over-year revenue growth rates.
Nonetheless, there was much to like in the report, with Services revenue of $23.1 billion reflecting a record and jumping 11.3% from the same period last year. iPhone revenues also showed growth, with $69.7 billion in quarterly revenue 6% higher year-over-year and exceeding our consensus expectations by a modest 1.5%.
Interestingly enough, iPhone results snapped a back-to-back streak of negative surprises.

Unsurprisingly, Apple continued to flex its cash-generating abilities, posting nearly $40 billion of operating cash flow. Margin expansion was also prevalent, moving higher from 42.9% to 45.6%.
The negative reaction among shares could likely be attributed to worries stemming from demand in China. Revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion, moving 13% lower year-over-year as the company faces competition in the area.
Bottom Line
Earnings season is always an exciting time. Beloved market titans Apple AAPL and Meta Platforms META revealed their results after the close today. META shares soared on news of a dividend and improved profitability, whereas AAPL shares faced pressure following worries about demand in China.

"February 01, 2024 — 06:20 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/strong-session-after-hours-earnings-from-aapl-amzn-meta-more,"Market activity got especially buoyant today, even after starting the session in the green across the board. What looked to be a short-term rally petering out gained steam around 11 am ET to close at session highs, on a series of data ranging from better-than-expected manufacturing and construction spending to hopes of a cease-fire in Gaza. The Dow finished up +369 points, +0.97%, while the S&P 500 was +1.25%. The Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 both ended the trading day +1.30%.

S&P Manufacturing PMI for January outperformed expectations by 60 basis points to 50.7, easily above the 50-point threshold demonstrating growth, while ISM Manufacturing PMI came in at 49.1% — below that 50 threshold but nicely higher than the 47.2% analysts were estimating. Construction Spending nearly doubled expectations to +0.9% from +0.5% anticipated, matching the previous month’s total. And even though a cease-fire in Gaza was not reached today, some earlier reports may have led investors to be more optimistic on this prospect today.

Today’s big news, however, is here after the closing bell: earnings reports from some of the biggest names, including three of the so-called “Magnificent 7” stocks: Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META. This last comes just a day after CEO Mark Zuckerberg was grilled on Capitol Hill about safety concerns for children on their social media platforms. We also see results from specialty apparel firm Deckers Outdoor DECK.

Apple reported fiscal Q1 results ahead of estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon: earnings of $2.19 per share beat the Zacks consensus by a solid dime, and were nicely ahead of the $1.88 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $119.58 billion outpaced the $117.6 billion expected. But weakness in China, and missed expectations in the iPad and Wearables groups are helping the stock dip -1.9% in late trading.

Amazon is doing much better, with Q4 earnings of $1.00 on revenues of a clean $170.0 billion easily surpassed the 80 cents per share and $166.26 billion analyst were looking for. Revenue guidance for next quarter of between $138-143.5 billion is still within the earlier expectations, but Operating Margins on the retail side grew by a very solid +6.1%. AWS sales reached $24.2 billion — up +13% year over year but exactly in-line with estimates. Shares are up +8.5% at this hour.

Meta Platforms came in at $5.33 per share on earnings and $40.1 billion in revenues after today’s close in its Q4 report. However, there seems to be some discrepancy on the bottom-line here, in particular with the previous year’s $1.76 per share as reported by the company; we had $3.00. Daily Active Users (DAU) rose +6% for the year to 2.11 billion, and the company now offers its first-ever monthly dividend of 50 cents per share. Meta has also reduced headcount by -22% year over year.

Deckers Outdoor brought the real prize of the afternoon, however, with earnings of $15.11 trouncing the $11.40 in the Zacks consensus, on revenues of $1.56 billion versus $1.44 billion expected. These are record numbers on both revenues and earnings. With inventories down during the 2023 holiday season, it appears Deckers has hit the sweet spot, with Gross Margins up at +58.7% and $1.6 billion in cash.  Shares are up a solid +4.87% on this news.

Tomorrow morning, the big news will be the U.S. non-farm payroll data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is supposed to bring in roughly 185K new jobs, with an Unemployment Rate ticking slightly higher to 3.8%. However, if yesterday’s ADP private-sector jobs report and this morning’s Jobless Claims data are any indication, we may see some room for BLS figures to hit below their target tomorrow.

"February 01, 2024 — 06:04 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-and-meta-surge-after-results-while-apple-drops,"By Noel Randewich
Feb 1 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms META.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O added a combined $280 billion in stock market value late on Thursday after the Big Tech duo reported quarterly results that impressed investors, while Apple's AAPL.O value shrank by $70 billion after its results.
Meta's stock surged over 14% to a record high $451 after the bell, elevating its market capitalization by $148 billion to $1.16 trillion after the Facebook owner declared its first-ever dividend.
While dividends are associated with mature, slow-growth companies, Meta delivered a 25% jump in revenue to $40.1 billion for the December quarter, fueled by robust advertising and device sales.
Amazon's stock jumped 8% after the company beat December-quarter revenue expectations on strong growth in online spending during the critical holiday shopping season. That put the online shopping and cloud-computing heavyweight's market capitalization at $1.78 trillion.
Apple's quarterly results beat analysts' expectations, but its sales in China missed estimates and its stock dipped 3.3%. Apple faces tough competition in China, which has worried Wall Street in recent months.
Investor optimism about generative AI drove rallies in the U.S. stock market's most valuable companies last year, with many hitting all-time highs in recent sessions.
Microsoft MSFT.O in January eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging in the artificial-intelligence race between Wall Street's tech heavyweights.
Asked on an investor call about generative AI, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, ""We've got some things that we're incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.""
Microsoft's lead over Apple in stock market value will probably grow over the next five years thanks to its early advantage in AI, 13 analysts consulted last week by Reuters unanimously agreed.
""For Apple to be able to accelerate growth, we would need either a material contribution from new products like the Vision Pro or a generative AI driven cycle to come through the iPhone 16,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said following its results.
Apple starts U.S. sales of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday.
In its report after the bell, Meta said its 2024 capital expenditures would reach between $30 billion and $37 billion, a $2 billion increase over its previous plan, driven by investments in servers, some of which will be used for AI.

"February 01, 2024 — 05:40 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-aapl-q1-earnings-and-revenues-surpass-estimates,"Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.18 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.88 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.31%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering a surprise of 5.04%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
Apple, which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, posted revenues of $119.58 billion for the quarter ended December 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.66%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $117.15 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Apple shares have lost about 4.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.6%.
What's Next for Apple?
While Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.59 on $95.32 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.59 on $392.79 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Mini computers is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
HP (HPQ), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2024.
This personal computer and printer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.8% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.
HP's revenues are expected to be $13.56 billion, down 2% from the year-ago quarter.

"February 01, 2024 — 05:13 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/checkmate-buying-qualcomm-stock-is-a-winning-move-in-2024.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
If you want to bolster your portfolio’s tech-sector holdings but feel that the “Magnificent Seven” stocks are too pricey, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a perfect pick. A thorough Qualcomm stock analysis reveals a great investment opportunity. It checks all of the boxes, whether you’re interested in growth, a good value, or passive income.
Besides, Qualcomm has a long-term arrangement with a famous “Mag-Seven” company. This partnership could keep Qualcomm stock afloat for years to come. Ultimately, Qualcomm proves to reluctant investors that not all large-cap technology companies are overpriced, and there are “magnificent” values if you know where to find them.
Qualcomm CEO Is Confident About Chip Supply and Demand
As you are probably aware, the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips has been quite intense. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon recently acknowledged this, suggesting that AI-compatible chips are a “great tailwind” for the company.
Indeed, Amon sees the generative AI trend as “one of the most exciting things” for Qualcomm. The demand is certainly there for AI-enabled hardware, but some investors may be concerned about whether there’s enough manufacturing capacity to meet that demand.
On that topic, Amon warned, “We’re going to have to double the total capacity of manufacturing of chips before the end of the decade.” Fortunately, the Qualcomm CEO assured, “[W]e think that there’s enough capacity,” and, “[R]ight now, we don’t have a capacity problem.”
Just as the gen-AI phenomenon will benefit the “Mag Seven,” it will also benefit Qualcomm. Remember, Qualcomm manufactures a variety of tech-hardware components. So, if the demand for AI chips and other components grows, Qualcomm will have opportunities to scale up and generate significant revenue.
Apple Deal Could Put a Floor on QCOM Stock
There are plenty of data points that bolster the bull case for Qualcomm stock. For example, there a good value proposition here, as Qualcomm’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.69x isn’t unreasonable at all. To provide some perspective, the sector median P/E ratio is 28.56x.
Furthermore, Qualcomm offers a forward annual dividend yield of 2.05%. This beats the technology sector’s average dividend of 1.025% – and by the way, some “Mag Seven” companies don’t pay any dividends at all.
Adding to the value proposition of QCOM stock – and possibly putting a floor on its price – is Qualcomm’s extended partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Specifically, Qualcomm has a deal with Apple to supply chips for Apple’s smartphones and other products.
This deal is currently extended through 2026. Granted, it’s not an exclusive agreement, so Apple could also source these components from other suppliers. Nevertheless, the extended arrangement with Apple is a definite win for Qualcomm. Over the long term, it could provide some stability to the Qualcomm stock price.
Qualcomm Stock Analysis: Multiple Reasons to Buy Today
What did our Qualcomm stock analysis reveal? First, not all mega-cap technology companies offer dividends, but Qualcomm does. Also, Qualcomm is not overvalued among tech-sector companies.
Moreover, Qualcomm’s CEO is confident about the company’s ability to meet the demand for AI-enabled hardware components. On top of all that, Qualcomm’s agreement with Apple should help to stabilize QCOM stock. Therefore, if you’re looking for a winning move in 2024, just start a share position in Qualcomm.

"February 01, 2024 — 05:03 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/morning-bid-asia-rocky-week-to-end-on-tech-led-bounce,"By Jamie McGeever
Feb 2 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.
Asian markets on Friday will look to take heart from Wall Street's bounce on Thursday, ending a rocky week on a steadier footing as investors digest the latest twists in the U.S. rate outlook, China's travails and Japan's solid start to the year.
China's CSI 300 index of blue chip stocks will likely close in the red this week, but a gain of around 0.5% will avert the biggest weekly fall since October, while the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index is on track for a slender weekly gain.
Japan's Nikkei 225 fell on Thursday but still closed out January with a gain of 8.5% and a series of fresh 34-year highs, while the yen's 3.6% fall was its biggest monthly depreciation in almost a year.
A bit of consolidation on both fronts on Friday and into next week would not be a huge surprise. Or shouldn't be.
The regional economic and policy calendar on Friday is light with only South Korean consumer inflation, Australian producer price inflation and Singapore's manufacturing PMI on tap, leaving investors to take their cue from global markets.
That should mean a feel good factor runs through Asia at the open on Friday after Wall Street's big three indices rebounded 1% or more on Thursday.
Earnings reports from tech giants Apple AAPL.O, Amazon.comAMZN.O and Meta PlatformsMETA.O after the bell on Thursday generally beat analysts' expectations, which should add to that positive sentiment.
All this will help wash over the flurry of worry around U.S. commercial real estate and regional banks - at least for now - although that part of the market remains under pressure. The KBW Regional Banking index .KRX fell 2%, following its 6% slide the day before.
Asian currencies, meanwhile, end the week better bid as the dollar's gentle drift lower continues. The decline has been nothing major, but the momentum that pushed the greenback higher across the board in the early part of the year has definitely faded.
The main reason is probably the slide in U.S. bond yields - the 10-year yield retreated to 3.86% on Thursday, its lowest this year - although there appears to be a bit less conviction in the market's dovish outlook for the Fed this year.
A higher-than-expected reading of South Korean inflation could give the won a shot in the arm on Friday.
Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday:
- South Korea inflation (December)
- Australia PPI inflation (December)
- Singapore manufacturing PMI (January)

"February 01, 2024 — 05:00 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aapl-stock-outlook-2024%3A-can-apple-outsmart-microsoft,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the only public company with a $3 trillion market capitalization, $130 million higher than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). While both companies have wonderful businesses, AAPL stock analysis suggests it might fall behind Microsoft in 2024. 
What can Apple shareholders like Warren Buffett do about the fact Microsoft is killing it in the all-important area of artificial intelligence? There isn’t anything they can do except wait for CEO Tim Cook to come up with a product that drives revenue like AI will.
In the meantime, MSFT stock has more than doubled Apple’s performance over the past year (65% for the former compared to 30% for the latter) and looks ready to widen the lead in 2024. 
What are analysts saying about the gap in the two companies’ valuations? Is there any hope for Apple shareholders that 2024 won’t be sideways to a lower type of year in the markets?
Let’s consider what the analysts say about Apple’s current problem.
No Relief From iPhone Sales Slowdown
CNBC recently reported comments from TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. According to the analyst, iPhone sales, especially in China, will likely fall in 2024, as much as 15%. 
“Kuo wrote that Apple’s weekly shipments in China have fallen by 30% to 40% from a year earlier in recent weeks, ‘and this downward trend is expected to continue,’ CNBC reported Kuo’s comments on Jan. 30. 
‘Apple may have the most significant decline among the major global mobile phone brands in 2024.’”
Between foldable phones and Huawei’s comeback in China, Apple’s been pushed in the past year like never before. It will need to respond to the competitive threats facing its biggest moneymaker. 
According to Yahoo Finance data, the analyst estimate for Apple’s revenue in the latest quarter is $108.77 billion, 7% lower than a year earlier. That’s on top of a 5% decline in Q1 2023. 
How Strong Is Services Revenue?
Not every estimate has Apple’s iPhone revenue declining in Q1 2024. A Reuters report from Jan. 31 suggested that its quarterly iPhone sales rose 3%, the best growth in five quarters. However, almost all Apple analysts expect 2024 to be a challenging year for iPhone sales. 
As a result, its Services segment will have to do much of the heavy lifting in 2024. 
In Q1 2024, LSEG expects revenue from the segment, including advertising, App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc., to rise 12.5% over last year to $23.4 billion. The segment’s gross margin in Q4 2023 was nearly 71%. It contributes 39% of Apple’s gross profit despite generating less than 18% of revenue.
In Q1 2023, its services revenue increased by 6.4%. Generating double the growth a year later would tremendously contribute to the overall business. I suspect advertising has something to do with it. 
Statista data says Apple’s U.S. ad revenue in 2020 was $2.2 billion. In 2024, it’s expected to be $6.2 billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 29.6%. If it were to maintain this CAGR through 2028, its annual ad revenue would be $17.5 billion, almost as much as its current Services revenue.
In March 2023, Investor’s Business Daily discussed how Apple’s ad business was underappreciated.
“‘We believe Apple advertising on its own apps is underappreciated,’ Barclays analyst Tim Long said in a note to clients Tuesday. ‘Most ad revenues are generated on the App Store, with some contribution from News and Stocks. This could expand to other apps like Maps, TV+, Podcasts, etc.,’” IBD reported. 
Long’s estimate for ad revenue is $19 billion by 2026, $1.5 billion higher than my estimate above, but two years earlier.
While analysts might be worried about its upcoming Q1 2024 report, it’s clear that Services won’t be a part of the growth deficit facing Apple in 2024. 
The Bottom Line
I don’t think there’s any question that Apple remains a formidable tech company. That said, it’s clear that its Products business is facing revenue headwinds that should limit its growth. 
As I write this, AAPL stock has barely moved in 2024, up slightly over 1%. It reports earnings on Feb. 1 after the close. By the time this is published, the results could already be out. 
Apple stock trades at 7.8x sales, which isn’t cheap relative to its five-year average. However, compared to Microsoft’s multiple of 13.4x, it’s the value play of the two.
Should AAPL stock fall on its earnings news, long-term investors shouldn’t hesitate to buy on weakness.

"February 01, 2024 — 04:45 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-stocks-to-buy-after-earnings-in-a-week-highlighted-by-tech,"Investors are certainly sifting through winners in this week’s busy earnings lineup which featured results from tech giants Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT on Tuesday with Apple (AAPL), Amazon AMZN, and Meta Platforms META set to report after the bell today.
With that being said, several tech stocks are standing out after strong quarterly results outside of these Magnificent Seven players and here are a few to consider.   
Celestica CLS
Celestica is one of the largest electronics manufacturing services companies in the world and its fourth quarter results on Monday did not disappoint. Fourth quarter earnings of $0.76 a share came in 12% better than expected and climbed 35% from EPS of $0.56 in Q4 2022. On the top line, Q4 sales of $2.14 billion beat estimates by 3% and rose 5% year over year.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
More importantly, Celestica finished fiscal 2023 with total sales up 10% to $7.96 billion and posted record annual earnings of $2.43 per share which was a 28% increase. Celestica’s full-year operating margin of 5.6% was also a company record and CEO Rob Mionis stated the strong momentum is continuing into 2024. It's noteworthy that CLS shares have now rallied an astonishing +165% over the last year but still trade at a very reasonable 11.8X forward earnings multiple.

Super Micro Computer SMCI
As a Total IT Solution provider for AI, Cloud, Storage, and 5G, Super Micro Computer’s robust growth continues to stand out after its fiscal second quarter results on Monday. Super Micro posted Q2 earnings of $5.59 per share which topped the Zacks Consensus by 2% and soared 71% from $3.26 a share in the prior-year quarter.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
More impressive, Q2 sales of $3.66 billion easily surpassed estimates of $3.21 billion by 14% and skyrocketed 103% from $1.8 billion a year ago. Super Micro attributed the very stellar results to its optimized AI computer platforms along with its Total IT solutions which continue to help the company take market share. To that point, Super Micro’s stock has been one the best performers over the last year with shares catapulting a remarkable +620% to even top Nvidia’s NVDA +198%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Woodward WWD
Reporting its fiscal first quarter results on Monday, energy control and optimization solutions provider Woodward is intriguing as well. Providing its service solutions to the aerospace and industrial markets, Woodward’s Q1 EPS of $1.45 crushed the Zacks Consensus of $1.10 a share by 32% and climbed 124% from $0.49 a share in the comparative quarter.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Woodward beat top line estimates by 6% with quarterly sales at $786.73 million which was up 27% YoY. The significant sales growth and margin expansion were driven by robust end-market demand in both its Aerospace and Industrial segments and improved operational performance. Woodward’s stock has risen a respectable +32% over the last year and there could be more upside as the company raised most of its key financial guidance for fiscal 2024 based on strengthening business operations in China.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bottom Line
At the moment, Celestica, Super Micro Computer, and Woodward’s stock all covet a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and are benefiting from strong business industries that are in the top 25% of over 250 Zacks industries. Now looks like a good time to buy these stocks as their strong price performances may continue after such impressive quarterly results.

Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded on Thursday as investors looked to a spate of high-profile earnings and the Friday's employment report a day after the Federal Reserve quashed lingering bets that interest rate cuts could begin as early as March.
While a broad rally sent all three major U.S. stock indexes sharply higher, the tech-laden Nasdaq advanced the most.
""There’s further digestion of the Fed,"" said Thomas Martin, Senior Portfolio Manager at GLOBALT in Atlanta. ""It’s still a growth market and yesterday's sell-off was an overreaction. So today we’re getting a rally.""

On Wednesday, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) left its policy rate unchanged as expected. At his press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell called a March rate cut ""unlikely,"" resetting market expectations of a dovish Fed pivot in the first quarter, and prompting a steep sell-off.
The KBW Regional Banking index .KRX fell 2.3%, weighed down by the 11.1% drop in New York Community Bancorp's NYCB.N shares after the company reported pain in its commercial real estate portfolio, sparking renewed fears over the health of U.S. regional lenders.
The broader S&P Banking index .SPXBK fared better, ending the day off 1.4%.
Fourth quarter reporting season is going full-bore, with 208 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 80% have delivered consensus-beating earnings, according to LSEG.
Analysts now expect aggregate S&P 500 earnings growth of 6.4% year-on-year for the October-December period, an improvement over the 4.7% growth seen on Jan. 1, per LSEG.
A raft of economic data showed rising productivity helping to cap labor costs, while an increase in announced layoffs and weekly jobless claims provided further evidence of softening in the labor market, which is viewed by the Fed as a precondition to assuring a sustainable downward path for inflation.
""We see these data, on the eve of the labor report tomorrow, as consistent with a healthy but moderating labor market,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Billings, Montana.

Feb 1 (Reuters) - Apple AAPL.O on Thursday reported China sales that missed Wall Street targets, overshadowing overall sales and profit that beat analysts' targets, powered by iPhone growth.
Apple shares were down 1.6% in after-hours trading.
The 2% rise in overall fiscal first-quarter sales for the company ended four straight quarters of sales declines on the strength of its iPhone 15 lineup, which includes devices capable of capturing three-dimensional video for the Vision Pro headset being released this week. Apple's total installed base of devices hit 2.2 billion, up from 2 billion a year ago.
""We did feel good about the plus 6% (revenue growth) for iPhone,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. ""We had particularly strong double-digit growth on iPhone in emerging markets outside of China. The iPhone is doing well in those markets.""
He added: ""China is the most competitive smartphone market in the world, and that hasn't changed.""
Cook told Reuters that iPhone sales in mainland China were down ""mid-single digits"" in the quarter, when accounting for currency exchange rates, although the company's installed base of iPhones in China is at an all-time high.
For its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30, Apple reported sales of $119.58 billion and profit of $2.18 per share, both above analyst expectations of $117.91 billion and $2.10 per share, according to data from LSEG.
Sales of iPhones hit $69.70 billion, growing 6% to beat analyst expectations of $67.82 billion, according to LSEG data.
Two other tech heavyweights, Amazon.com AMZN.O and Facebook owner Meta Platforms META.O, reported quarterly results on Thursday which led to jumps in their share prices.
Apple's results were seen as more mixed.
”The overall strength of iPhone 15 sales clearly reflected more pent-up demand for smartphones than expected, but the big miss in China is concerning as it could be the start of a longer downward trend there,"" said Bob O'Donnell, an analyst at TECHnalysis Research.
Microsoft MSFT.O in January eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging in the artificial-intelligence race between Wall Street's tech heavyweights. Apple's stock has dropped more than 3% in 2024, compared with the S&P 500's .SPX 2% increase.
Apple has said it is researching generative AI but has instead focused on its Vision Pro headset, which analysts do not expect to bring meaningful revenue for several years.
In the shorter term, analysts are increasingly worrying about sales of Apple's signature device in China, whose economy is navigating the burst of a real estate bubble. The iPhone also faces increasing competition in China and has fallen out of favor in government offices.
Apple said sales in China were $20.82 billion, missing analyst estimates of $23.53 billion, according to LSEG data.
Counterpoint Research reported China iPhone unit shipments fell during the quarter, with Chinese consumers looking to novel folding phones and homegrown rival Huawei, which re-entered the market with a flagship phone powered by a Chinese-made chip.
In the rest of Asia beyond China and Japan, Apple's sales hit $10.16 billion, above analyst estimates of $9.75 billion, according to LSEG data. Cook said that iPhone sales hit an all-time high in South Korea, home to Apple's longtime rival Samsung Electronics 005930.KS.
The biggest growth area for Apple during its fiscal first quarter was its services business, which includes the Apple TV+ service as well as music, iCloud storage and the App Store, and which rose 11% to $23.12 billion in sales. But those results were slightly below analyst expectations of $23.35 billion, according to LSEG data.
""The important services business was slightly lower than expected, which will likely be the most concerning item for investors since this business line continues to be the most important driver of growth,"" commented analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson.
Apple's App Store also faces a challenge in Europe, where a new law that takes effect in March will allow developers to skip paying commissions to Apple and place alternative app stores on the iPhone.
Apple's first-quarter Mac sales were up slightly to $7.78 billion, in line with analyst expectations of $7.73 billion, according to LSEG data. Sales of iPads were down 25% to $7.02 billion, missing expectations of $7.33 billion, according to LSEG data.
Apple's wearables segment, which includes its AirPods and Apple Watch sales, fell to $11.95 billion after company executives had warned of weak demand. The results were just above expectations of $11.56 billion, according to LSEG data.
Several Apple Watch models have been at the center of a legal dispute with medical device maker Masimo MASI.O and were briefly pulled from shelves before Apple removed a blood-oxygen monitoring features to comply with legal rulings and keep selling the devices.

Feb 1 (Reuters) - Apple AAPL.O on Thursday reported China sales that missed Wall Street targets, overshadowing overall sales and profit that beat analysts' targets, powered by iPhone growth.
Apple shares were down 1.6% in after-hours trading.
The 2% rise in overall fiscal first-quarter sales for the company ended four straight quarters of sales declines on the strength of its iPhone 15 lineup, which includes devices capable of capturing three-dimensional video for the Vision Pro headset being released this week. Apple's total installed base of devices hit 2.2 billion, up from 2 billion a year ago.
""We did feel good about the plus 6% (revenue growth) for iPhone,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. ""We had particularly strong double-digit growth on iPhone in emerging markets outside of China. The iPhone is doing well in those markets.""

Feb 1 (Reuters) - Wall Street bounced back on Thursday, after a selloff in the previous session as the U.S. Federal Reserve dashed hopes for early interest rate cuts, with focus moving to Big Tech earnings due later in the day.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Wednesday notched their biggest one-day percentage declines since September and October, respectively, after the Fed reminded markets of its undeterred focus on battling inflation, smashing speculations of policy easing kicking off in March.
Consumer staples shares .SPLRCS led gains with a 1.6% rise among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, boosted by a 3.3% jump in Altria Group MO.N after the tobacco giant posted a fourth-quarter profit beat and authorized a new share buyback plan.
Communication services shares .SPLRCL gained 1.1%, while the financial sector .SPSY was the only one in the red and down 0.4%.
A selloff in shares of U.S. regional banks continued on Thursday, with New York Community Bancorp NYCB.N down 10.7%.
The KBW Regional Banking index .KRX fell 3.7%, on track for its steepest two-day decline since March last year.
On the data front, weekly jobless claims rose to a seasonally adjusted 224,000, higher than the expected 212,000, while a report showed job cut announcements in January rose to a 10-month high.
Separately, U.S. manufacturing stabilized in January amid a rebound in new orders, but inflation at the factory gate picked up.
""The Fed needed more time to explore incoming data and they didn't feel the need to be in a hurry to cut. I was never expecting March,"" said Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors.
Focus moves back to Big Tech earnings that would shed light on whether megacap stocks can sustain their recent rally, fueled by the hype around artificial intelligence and hopes of early rate cuts.
Apple's AAPL.OiPhone sales are expected to have seen the best growth in five quarters, but analysts see a tough year for the company in China, while investors will monitor whether Amazon.com AMZN.O can cash in on its delivery heft by boosting fee revenue from its ""Buy With Prime"" service.
Meta Platforms META.O is likely to see a muted impact from generative AI on its advertising business.
The three tech giants, up between 0.9% and 1.6%, will report earnings after the closing bell, a day after investors punished Alphabet GOOGL.O and Microsoft MSFT.O on mounting costs of developing generative AI-powered products.
At 12:10 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 225.17 points, or 0.59%, at 38,375.47, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 40.29 points, or 0.83%, at 4,885.94, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 137.74 points, or 0.91%, at 15,301.75.
Merck MRK.N climbed 3.5% following the drug maker's upbeat fourth-quarter results, while Dow component Honeywell HON.O dropped 3.1% after the diversified industrial firm forecast a weak first-quarter profit.
Qualcomm QCOM.O fell 3.9% on concerns over Android sales in China.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.32-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.46-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 23 new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 51 new highs and 96 new lows.

“A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money.” While a trillion-dollar price tag is likely more common in today’s inflationary times, only a handful of companies have managed to attain that real-money status. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the first to do so in 2018 but six other stocks have since attained trillion-dollar valuations.
As the market expands and businesses grow, we’ll likely see more stocks join this elite group of companies. But it’s more than just becoming trillion-dollar milestone stocks. The lofty price tag indicates a company that dominates its industry and wields incredible influence. What follows are three industry heavyweights that are on their way to commanding similar leadership over their respective fields.
Broadcom (AVGO)

For Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to join Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the next chipmaker worth $1 trillion, it’s going to have to nearly double in valuation. It’s worth $550 billion now so it’s more than halfway there. As it seems with most businesses these days, artificial intelligence (AI) will be how it achieves it.
Broadcom said generative AI represented close to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter or 20% of total semiconductor revenue. Demand for its AI accelerators from hyperscalers, which are cloud service providers at scale, should drive networking revenue 30% higher in 2024.
Semiconductors remain Broadcom’s bread and butter though. Apple recently signed a multiyear, multibillion-dollar agreement for the chipmaker’s 5G radio frequency components for Apple products. The tech giant accounted for 20% of all Broadcom revenue in 2022 and 2023.
A third driver of growth for Broadcom will be its software business. It completed its acquisition of VMWare in November and will layer its business on top of the software operations it acquired over the years from CA, Symantec and Brocade. It now expects software will account for half of all revenue. 
Broadcom has become a well-diversified business. The semiconductor industry is very cyclical and the chipmaker has now smoothed out a lot of the volatility. It also lessened its dependence on Apple. It provides a straighter road for Broadcom to achieve trillion-dollar status very soon.
JPMorgan Chase (JPM)

A trillion-dollar bank might seem a difficult concept to grasp but JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is probably the first one that will achieve it. The bank is halfway there as well with a $504 billion valuation. If the economy can avoid any major tumults it might achieve it sooner than many imagine.
The high-interest rate environment we’re in will certainly benefit JPMorgan’s bottom line by accruing greater net interest income. Even as the Federal Reserve considers cutting rates it does not look like it will be in the five or six steps originally expected. Most analysts think there will be three at most. This is not some pie-in-the-sky wish-casting either. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Betsy Graseck called JPMorgan “an underappreciated rate play.” She also looks for the bank to benefit from increased fees and efficiencies.
JPMorgan has become a rock amidst the tempest of financial uncertainty. It’s much the way the bank’s namesake founder was the salvation of other Wall Street banks and the stock market after the 1907 panic that threatened to bring down the country’s entire financial system. It was JPMorgan that rescued First Republic bank during the regional banking meltdown a year ago.
JPM further benefited from the crisis as depositors flocked to its bank helping to boost its total assets to almost $4 trillion. At the end of 2023, JPMorgan held $3.9 trillion in assets. That’s 20% greater than its closest peer, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). It solidifies the banking giant’s grasp as the biggest, most valuable financial institution.
Novo Nordisk (NVO)

The last of the three stocks that will hit the trillion-dollar milestone is Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). At a $511 billion valuation, the Danish pharmaceutical giant arguably could do it sooner than the other two.
Novo Nordisk is leading the way forward with its twin glycogen-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) therapies for diabetes and obesity, Wegovy and Ozempic. Sales are rocketing higher and show no sign of letting up. Ozempic sales surged 66% in currency-adjusted rates while Wegovy went stratospheric with 420% gains. Based on the strength of the sales, Novo Nordisk now expects revenue to grow by as much as 26% this year with operating profits surging 29% higher.
Demand for the drugs is so great Novo Nordisk has struggled to keep up. It’s employed third-party contractors to help and committed to spending nearly $9 billion in new capacity. It does have new competition in the space from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), which means the stock likely won’t maintain its torrid rate of growth. Share are up 65% in the past year.
The pharma stock just completed a 2-for-1 stock split in September after shares quadrupled in value over the past five years. It would require a smaller gain for NVO stock to reach $1 trillion but achieving it is not out of the question.

"February 01, 2024 — 11:05 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-massive-growth-stocks-that-turned-%245000-into-more-than-%241-million-in-20-years,"If you're investing in up-and-coming growth stocks, you don't necessarily need to make a huge investment to generate massive returns later on. You can make up for that by investing for a long period. Two stocks that have provided investors with life-changing returns over the past 20 years are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Here's how much $5,000 invested in these stocks 20 years ago would be worth today.
Nvidia: $1.6 million
Nvidia was always a popular name in tech for its graphics cards, but over the past few years things have really taken off for the business. The rising implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and the popularity of ChatGPT (and other generative AI applications) have created significant demand for the company's chips, with Nvidia looking to play a prominent role in AI's growth. There were approximately 10,000 chips used in the creation of ChatGPT, and with Nvidia dominating the market for AI chips (with close to an 80% share by some estimates), its business has flourished. Over the past three quarters, the company's revenue has jumped by 86% year over year to nearly $39 billion. Earnings, meanwhile, have skyrocketed from less than $3 billion to more than $17 billion.
According to analysts from Bank of America, as demand for AI services and chatbots rises in the future, Nvidia may be able to add another $14 billion in revenue to its top line by 2027. That's a significant chunk for a company that in fiscal 2023, which ended in January of last year, generated just under $27 billion in sales.
Since the start of 2004, Nvidia's stock has generated incredible returns for investors, with a $5,000 investment back then now being worth nearly $1.6 million. Given its high valuation today, it's unlikely that Nvidia can have a repeat performance over the next 20 years. But with much more growth ahead, it may still not be too late to invest into one of the market's best AI stocks.
Apple: $2.4 million
Apple was in trouble in the 90s, and was close to bankruptcy in 1997. Its rival, Microsoft, provided the business with a much-needed lifeline, investing $150 million into the computer company at the time.
Since then, things have gone a lot better for Apple. A big part of the reason is the iPhone. While Apple's Mac computers are popular today, it was the launch of the iPhone that really transformed the business and which made it an exciting, innovative company to invest in. Over the years, the company has launched iPads and other services, but its bread and butter remains the iPhone. It all links back to there.
With close to 1.5 billion active iPhone users in the world, Apple has a strong customer base it can upsell products and services to. And even though the newest iPhone iterations may not offer groundbreaking new technologies, many of its most devout customers still crave the latest and greatest iPhone.
In the company's most recent fiscal year (ended Sept. 30, 2023), Apple did more than $200 billion in iPhone sales, which was down only 2% from a year ago, even despite inflation and rising interest rates. In a true testament to the company's versatility and strong brand, the business' top product still did fairly well given some challenging economic conditions.
Apple's business still has room to grow, particularly in services, where subscriptions can help provide it with recurring revenue that it can build on over time as it gives its users more of a reason to go deeper into its ecosystem. From music to streaming to news, there are plenty of services that can help give Apple's top line more of a boost in the future.
Its near-$3-trillion valuation can make Apple's business seem expensive, but with a loyal customer base, and a large one at that, this too can still be a good investment to hold in your portfolio for the long haul.

When contemplating “AgeTech stocks,” you might automatically think of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with its younger demographic first. However, Apple has also proven to be an ageless company, with impressive uptake across many demographics due to its versatility and popularity. For most investors, AAPL stock remains a core portfolio holding, given this stock’s massive weighting in most major indices. Thus, like it or not, most passive investors’ futures are already linked quite closely to Apple’s long-term performance.
This company’s cash cow is clearly its iPhone, which continues to make up the most sizable chunk of its revenue and earnings each year. But the company is also focused on other high-growth segments such as wearables and high-margin businesses such as services to boost its profitable growth profile over the long-term.
The question is whether Apple can continue to see stock price growth, given its impressive valuation of more than 31-times earnings. Let’s dive in.
The Bull Case
Apple’s success is not only made up by its hardware division. Rather, the company’s growing services segment including favorites like Apple Pay and iCloud is driving a significant amount of the company’s profitability. In the fiscal year of 2023, services revenue upped by 9%, making up 22% of the company’s sales. This segment doesn’t just provide world-class profitability with a 71% gross margin, but also promotes customer loyalty. It drives repeat purchases and preferences over other competitors.
In 2023, AAPL stock achieved a market cap of $3 trillion, but iPhone demand kept the company on their toes. Following a rally in December, Wedbush estimates a $4 trillion market cap could be possible in 2024, expecting growth and monetization to pick up. Apple’s shares increased by an abundant 52% over the past year, so the market appears to be taking such a view.
There’s also anticipation for Apple to announce its first year-over-year revenue and its most considerable earnings per share boost in more than two years in its upcoming Q1 2024 earnings report. Apple’s expected net income could reach a sizeable $32.56 billion in the February 1 report. This would translate to an 11% year-over-year improvement in the company’s earnings per share numbers, to $2.09. Revenue is predicted to rise just a little under 1%.
Thus, it’s all about the profit story for Apple right now.
The Bear Case
Apple continues to battle various challenges related to slowing revenue for core products and the saturation of the mobile phone market. Moreover, hesitation about the Chinese market, which makes up 19% of Apple’s revenue in fiscal 2023, worries investors.
The ruffling of feathers between the United States and China caused by the trade war during the Trump presidency continues to persist in the current administration. Amid these geopolitical tensions, Chinese consumers are increasingly opting for Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro, which offers an advanced chip, over the new iPhone.
In late October, Bloomberg reported that iPhone 15 sales fell behind its previous model due to the comeback of Huawei’s top device. Within the geopolitical landscape, Apple could potentially lose value, and some believe that Apple’s current valuation could result in a rather significant decline from its peak from here.
Buy with Caution
There are certainly reasons to be bearish on Apple in the near-term. The headwinds bears point out are prominent, and are the reason Apple has given up its mantle as the world’s most valuable company recently.
That said, this mega-cap consumer discretionary technology player is the best-in-class option in its space. With a strong and loyal customer base and a growing ecosystem of products Apple users rely on, the company’s steady cash flow growth and strong cash buffer do act as a relative buffer in these uncertain times.
Thus, I remain cautiously bullish on AAPL stock for the long-term. I think many in the market are likely to think the same way, with any sort of major dip bought, at least in the coming years. That said, I do think now is the time to buckle up for some turbulence, and it’s never a bad idea to diversify one’s portfolio.

"February 01, 2024 — 10:50 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jobless-claims-increased-more-than-expected-1,"New Jobless Claims numbers this morning continue to put a subtly different tilt on our current labor market: just like yesterday’s lower-than-expected ADP (ADP) private-sector payroll tallies, ahead of today’s opening bell we see both new and longer-term jobless claims jump unexpectedly higher. Initial claims came in 10K higher than estimates to 224K — the highest weekly print since mid-August of last year, and north of the upwardly revised previous week’s 215K. Continuing Claims reached 1.898 million — the loftiest number since before Thanksgiving, and a week-over-week leap of 70K new longer-term claims.
Q4 Productivity also came in hotter than projections: +3.2% versus the +2.5% consensus estimate. This is still well off the previous quarter’s +4.9% pace (which has been downwardly revised from the previous +5.2% reported), which itself was the strongest productivity figure since the +5.7% of the pandemic-ridden Q3 2020. Meanwhile, Unit Labor Costs were cut more than in half from estimates of +1.2% to +0.5%. In summation, higher-than-expected productivity with lower-than-expected labor costs are indicative of a strong economy.
After today’s market opens, two Manufacturing PMI numbers — from S&P and ISM — for January. Both are expected to tick down a tad from the previous month’s reads. Also, Construction Spending for December and January Auto Sales (releases dispersed throughout the day, based on manufacturers’ reporting schedules) will hit the tape as the day moves forward.
Once the market closes, we’ll await earnings reports from a large swath of the so-called “Magnificent 7” stocks: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms (META) all come out with hotly expected quarterly numbers (leaving only NVIDIA [NVDA] as the remaining “Mag 7” company to report). Expectations for earnings growth are +11.7% for Apple, +61% for Meta and a whopping +285% for Amazon, year over year.
Ahead of today’s open, we also have a slew of earnings reports out. In the interest of saving time, we’ll highly just a few with strong Zacks Ranks as of the time of the earnings release.
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Cardinal Health (CAH) outperformed expectations in its fiscal Q2, with earnings of $1.82 per share outpacing the $1.56 expected (and notably above last year’s $1.32 per share), with quarterly revenues +1.10% from the Zacks consensus to $57.45 billion. Shares are selling the news, however, though this may be the result of having gained +8% year to date and its announced acquisition of Specialty Networks for $1.12 billion.
International Paper (IP), which carried a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) into its Q4 earnings report this morning, put up mixed numbers: earnings of 41 cents per share outperformed the 34 cents anticipated for a +20.6% earnings surprise, while revenues of $4.6 billion came in shy of expectations by -1.9%. Shares are trading down -2% on the news, so the expected move higher from this industrial stalwart appears as if it’s going to have to wait a little longer.
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated Honeywell (HON) reported earnings of $2.60 per share, which met estimates exactly (though higher than the $2.52 per share reported in the year-ago quarter), while revenues of $9.44 billion came in -2.7% shy of the Zacks consensus. Like IP’s stock performance, lately the industrial conglomerate has been hitting the skids: -2.3% on the news of the Q4 release compounds the -3.6% for the company, year to date.

"February 01, 2024 — 10:37 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/canada-stocks-tsx-rises-as-materials-stocks-gain,"By Purvi Agarwal
Feb 1 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index rose on Thursday boosted by materials stocks, while investors repriced their expectations of the first rate cut to May by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
At 10:07 a.m. ET (15:07 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index .GSPTSE was up 102.28 points, or 0.49%, at 21,124.16.
Materials stocks .GSPTTMT were the top gainers on the index, rising 1.5%, pulled up by Methanex Corp. MX.TOwhich rose 3.7% after it beat analysts' estimates for the fourth quarter.
The sector is set for its best day since Jan. 23 if gains hold.
Healthcare stocks .GSPTTHC trended upwards with a 1.2% rise, snapping a two-day losing streak.
While the Fed clearly indicated no possibility of a rate cut in March, markets took comfort in Chair Jerome Powell's commentary that the cuts will be sizeable for 2024.
""Powell's comments were a lot to chew on. He pretty much ruled out the possibility of a rate cut in March, but he also definitely set the table for a strong possibility of rate relief later this year"", said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
""Even if the first rate has been pushed back a little bit, the financial markets are still very enthusiastic that there could be upwards of 150 basis points of rate cuts this year or six cuts by the Fed.""
Meanwhile, Canadian manufacturing activity declined for a ninth straight month in January, but there was a slowdown in the pace of contraction as inflation pressures eased, data showed on Thursday.
Money market participants shifted their focus to the three tech giants - Apple AAPL.O, Meta META.O and Amazon AMZN.O- that will report earnings after the closing bell in the U.S.
Amongst individual stocks, luxury parka maker Canada Goose GOOS.TO climbed 5.5% after it forecast its fourth-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates.

"February 01, 2024 — 10:07 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/magnificent-seven-earnings-contributions-cant-be-denied,"Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) are among the magnificent seven members that have delivered fourth-quarter results. The cadre of high-growth mega-caps will be pivotal drivers of S&P 500 EPS for the final three months of last year and beyond.
That implies upcoming earnings reports from the rest of the magnificent seven. And those delivered by the entire group over the course of 2024 will be big events for ETFs such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM).
Relative to S&P 500-tracking funds, those two ETFs are significantly overweight the magnificent seven. That group includes the aforementioned trio of stocks as well as Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN) and semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA).
Magnificent Seven Earnings Could Power QQQ, QQQM
There are concerns about the level of concentration some large-cap equity ETFs possess in the magnificent seven. But hefty allocations to those stocks served QQQ/QQQM investors well last year. That could be the case again in 2024. That's particularly so if these companies beat EPS forecasts. What’s not up for debate is that these seven juggernauts are expected to drive a major percentage of S&P 500 EPS for 2023 and perhaps 2024.
“Six of the seven companies in the ‘Magnificent 7’ are projected to be the top six positive contributors to year-over-year earnings for the S&P 500 for Q4 2023: NVIDIA, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Apple. In aggregate, these six companies are expected to report year-over-year earnings growth of 53.7% for the fourth quarter,” noted FactSet’s John Butters. “Excluding these six companies, the blended (combines actual and estimated results) earnings decline for the remaining 494 companies in the S&P 500 would be -10.5% for Q4 2023. Overall, the blended earnings decline for the entire S&P 500 for Q4 2023 is -1.4%.”
Key Data Points for QQQ & QQQM Investors
Those data points take on added importance for QQQ and QQQM investors. That's because Amazon.com, Apple, and Meta Platforms will deliver quarterly results in the coming days. As things stand today, Tesla is the only magnificent seven member that wasn’t a positive contributor to S&P 500 year-over-year EPS growth in 2023. But that could change for the better in 2024. Speaking of this year…
“It is interesting to note that four of these six companies are also projected to be the top four contributors to earnings growth for the S&P 500 for Q1 2024: Nvidia, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet. In aggregate, these four companies are projected to report year-over-year earnings growth of 79.7% for Q1 2024,” concluded Butters.

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Tata Group is in advanced talks with Taiwan's Pegatron 4938.TW to form a partnership to run an iPhone assembly plant the Indian company is building in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.
Tata is building the iPhone assembly plant in Hosur city, which will be its second such facility in the country. The move comes as Apple AAPL.O and its contract manufacturers are rapidly expanding their India operations.
Tata is in talks to form a joint venture with Pegatron for the Hosur plant - its first such initiative - that would help speed up its plans to start manufacturing, said the two sources, who declined to be named as the talks are private and the deal has not been closed.
The Taiwanese firm would provide technical and engineering support at the plant, the sources said.
Pegatron did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside business hours in Taiwan. Tata and Apple also did not immediately respond.
Tata's success is crucial to Apple's ambitions. The U.S. firm has been diversifying beyond China following COVID-19 disruptions and geopolitical tensions and the proportion of iPhones made in India is expected to reach 20-25% this year, from 12-14% in 2023, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
Tata's new plant with Pegatron is expected to have 20 lines for iPhone assembly, one of the sources said, adding that the Indian firm would hold a majority stake in the joint venture.
""Tata cannot build everything from scratch,"" said the second source, explaining the rationale behind the tie-up.
Tata's first iPhone assembly plant is in the southern state of Karnataka which it took over from Taiwan's Wistron last year.
Independently, Pegatron already operates an iPhone assembly plant in Tamil Nadu and is in talks to add a second facility. It currently accounts for about 10% of Apple's iPhone output in India, with Taiwan's Foxconn accounting for most of the rest.

"February 01, 2024 — 09:30 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-news-for-feb-1-2024,"U.S. stocks ended sharply lower on Wednesday, recording their biggest daily decline of 2024, after the Federal Reserve kept its interest rates steady but said that it would likely not be ready to go for a rate cut in March. All three major indexes ended in negative territory.
How Did The Benchmarks Perform?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) slid 0.8% or 317.01 points to close at 38,150.30 points, recording its biggest single-day decline since December.
The S&P 500 fell 1.6% or 79.3 points, to end at 4,845.65 points, recording its biggest single-day percentage point drop since September. Tech, consumer discretionary and communication services stocks were the biggest losers.
The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) declined 2.1%, while the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) dropped 1.8%. The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) lost 2.5%, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) gave up 1.9%. All 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 2.2% or 345.89 points to finish at 15,164.01 points, recording its worst day since October.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 7.81% to 14.35. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 3-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.8-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. A total of 13.3 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 11.5 billion.
Fed Dashes Hopes of March Rate Cut
Investors had been awaiting the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s two-day FOMC meeting, which concluded on Wednesday. The meeting was expected to give a clearer picture of the Fed’s next course of action with interest rates.
The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged in its current range of 5.25-5.50%, which was widely anticipated after it indicated last year that the central bank’s monetary tightening campaign is likely to end soon and rate cuts would be implemented in 2024.
However, hopes were dashed after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that it is unlikely that the central bank would be ready to go for the first rate cut in March, as inflation is still above its 2% target.
“I don’t think it’s likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March is the time to do that,” Powell said after the meeting.
Investors were optimistic that cooling inflation could see the Fed go for its first rate cut in March but Powell said that the central bank is closely monitoring the inflation data and more encouraging data is required before rate cuts are implemented.
However, the Federal Reserve sounded a bit dovish as it eliminated the portion of the earlier statement that indicated the central bank retained a tightening bias. Specifically, the Fed did away with the phrase alluding to ""additional policy firming.""
Powell’s comments dented investors’ sentiment, which took a toll on the stocks, with the tech sector suffering the most. Shares of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) plummeted 7.5%, recording its worst day since Oct 25.
Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) fell 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Treasury yields made wild swings but narrowed their declines after the Federal Reserve issued its revised statement. However, the 10-year Treasury yield remained below the 4% threshold in the market.
Investors also closely watched a spate of big companies report quarterly results but it was overshadowed by the Fed’s meeting.
Economic Data
In economic data released on Wednesday, Automatic Data Processing (ADP) reported that private payroll growth fell in January. The U.S. economy added 107,000 jobs in January, lower than December’s upwardly revised 158,000.
Monthly Roundup
Although Wednesday’s sharp decline ate into January’s gains, all three indexes closed the month higher. The Dow rose 1.2% in January. The S&P 500 was up 1.6% for the month, while the Nasdaq added 1%.

"February 01, 2024 — 09:17 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-sp-500-nasdaq-eye-higher-open-after-fed-driven-selloff,"By Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian
Feb 1 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were set to open higher on Thursday, following a selloff in the previous session after the Federal Reserve dashed hopes for early interest rate cuts, with focus now on economic data and Big Tech earnings later in the day.
The S&P 500 .SPX and the tech-laden Nasdaq .IXIC on Wednesday notched their biggest one-day percentage declines since September and October, respectively, while the Dow .DJI saw its steepest decline in six weeks.
Keeping interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, the Fed reminded markets of its undeterred focus on battling inflation and smashed speculations of policy easing kicking off in March.
Fresh data on Thursday showed initial jobless claims for the week ended Jan. 27 rose to a seasonally adjusted 224,000, higher than expectations of 212,000, according to economists polled by Reuters.
""Probabilities for March is taking a serious hit but that could change overnight ... we're seeing signs of that with jobless claims coming in much hotter than expected,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital LLC.
Meanwhile, another report showed job cut announcements in January rose to a 10-month high as employers in the financial and technology sectors launched restructuring efforts.
Manufacturing PMI readings are also expected after market open.
Focus moves back to Big Tech earnings that would shed light on whether megacap stocks can sustain their recent rally, fueled by the hype around artificial intelligence and hopes of early rate cuts.
Apple's AAPL.OiPhone sales are expected to have seen the best growth in five quarters, but analysts see a tough year for the company in China, while investors will monitor whether Amazon.com AMZN.O can cash in on its delivery heft by boosting fee revenue from its ""Buy With Prime"" service.
Meta Platforms META.O is likely to see a muted impact from generative AI on its advertising business.
The three tech giants, up between 0.6% and 1.2% in premarket trading, will report earnings after the closing bell, a day after investors punished Alphabet GOOGL.O and Microsoft MSFT.O on mounting costs of developing generative AI-powered products.
At 8:49 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 10 points, or 0.03%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 19.5 points, or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 101.5 points, or 0.59%.
Merck MRK.N climbed 2.0% after the drug maker's upbeat fourth-quarter results, while Dow component Honeywell HON.O dropped 2.6% after the diversified industrial firm forecast a weak first-quarter profit.
Align Technology ALGN.O jumped 14.3% after forecasting first-quarter revenue above estimates, while Royal Caribbean Group RCL.N rose 3.9% after projecting 2024 profit above expectations.
Qualcomm QCOM.O fell 2.1% on concerns over Android sales in China, even though the chip maker forecast second-quarter profit slightly above estimates and in-line sales.
New York Community Bancorp NYCB.N recovered 2.9% after Wednesday's 38% slump.

"February 01, 2024 — 08:33 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/zacks-earnings-trends-highlights%3A-microsoft-alphabet-tesla-amazon-meta-and-apple,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – February 1, 2024– Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""S&P 500 index earnings are currently expected to be up +2.4% from the year-earlier level on +2.8% higher revenues, which would follow the +3.8% earnings growth in 2023 Q3 on +2.0% higher revenues.""
Q4 Earnings: Tech Flexes Strong Growth
Note: The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>
Here are the key points:
Total Q4 earnings for the 176 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +1.7% from the same period last year on +2.6% higher revenues, with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 69.3% beating revenue estimates.
Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 index earnings are currently expected to be up +2.4% from the year-earlier level on +2.8% higher revenues, which would follow the +3.8% earnings growth in 2023 Q3 on +2.0% higher revenues.
For the Tech sector, we now have Q4 results for 46.8% of the sector's market capitalization in the index. Total earnings for these Tech companies are up +19.3% from the same period last year on +6.6% higher revenues, with 82.1% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.
The Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Tech companies are notably tracking higher than what we have seen from these companies in other recent periods, though the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking modestly below other recent periods and the 20-quarter average.
The market's darling mega-cap Tech companies that we have been referring to as the 'Big 7 Tech Players' and everyone else as 'Magnificent 7', or 'Mag 7' for short, have started reporting results, with Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA now out with their December-quarter results. The still-to-come reports from this exalted club are comprised of Amazon AMZN, Meta META and Apple AAPL this week.
Total Q4 earnings for the 'Mag 7' (we have thrown in the towel and will be referring to the group by the same name) are expected to be up +41.3% from the same period last year on +13% higher revenues, which would follow the group's +54.2% higher earnings on +12.9% higher revenues in 2023 Q3.
Concerning the market reactions to the Microsoft and Alphabet results, both of these stocks had climbed significantly heading into the releases, on top of last year's impressive gains, suggesting that a sell-the-news type of reaction was the most likely outcome. Microsoft's results were relatively more impressive than Alphabet's numbers, but both companies came out with solid results.
Microsoft's Q4 earnings were up +25.9% on +17.6% higher revenues, while the same for Alphabet were up +51.8% on +14.6% higher revenues. Both companies came out with cloud revenues that represented acceleration over the preceding period, with Microsoft's cloud revenues up +30% from the same period last year and Alphabet's relatively smaller cloud business enjoying revenue growth of +26%.
The market's issue with the Alphabet report is related to the company's core ad business, which showed lower-than-expected growth of +11%.
The market reactions to these results notwithstanding, for companies the size of Microsoft and Alphabet to be able to achieve this magnitude of top- and bottom-line gains in this macro backdrop speaks to their enormous earnings power.
Beyond the Mag 7, Q4 earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +2.4% above the year-earlier period on +2.8% higher revenues. This would follow the +3.8% increase in index earnings in 2023 Q3 on +2.3% higher revenues.
Given the expected moderation in the U.S. economy's growth trajectory due to the cumulative effects of Fed tightening, these estimates likely need to come down. Some of that downward adjustment is already happening.
As we have noted before, full-year 2024 estimates started coming down in October, with the trend continuing in November and early December, but appear to have stabilized in recent weeks.

"February 01, 2024 — 08:00 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/time-for-value-etfs-as-march-rate-cut-unlikely,"Wall Street recorded declines on Wednesday, reacting to the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain current interest rates. This decision, coupled with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's indications that rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, particularly in March, triggered a negative response from investors. The Fed seek more evidence of declining inflation before any rate cuts are considered.
The S&P 500 lost more than 1.6% on Jan 31, 2024. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed about 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 added about 2% on Jan 31, 2024. This downturn marked the S&P 500's worst single-day performance since September, per a Yahoo Finance article.
March Interest Rate Cut Unlikely
During a press conference, Jerome Powell moderated expectations for a rate cut in March. He suggested that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to have enough confidence in falling inflation by the March meeting to consider a rate cut. This cautious stance led to a downbeat investor expectations, with the probability of a March rate cut, as per the CME FedWatch Tool, declining meaningfully from over 60% prior to the meeting to just about 36%.
Disappointing Tech Earnings Worsen Weak Market Sentiments
The market's rough start was further intensified by underwhelming earnings reports from major tech companies. Notably, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and AMD AMD, often referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" were at the forefront of these disappointing results.
Alphabet's 7.5% decline was particularly notable, leading the losses among these tech giants. The lackluster performance from these leading companies casts a shadow over the earnings season, with investors awaiting reports from other tech mega-caps like Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Meta META.
Why Value?
Since the growth sector relies on easy borrowing for superior growth and its value depends heavily on future earnings, a high interest rate scenario and a rise in long-term yields cuts the present value of companies’ future earnings.
And this is where value investing rises. Value stocks perform better in a rising rate environment. Moreover, during the peak of the pandemic, value stocks were hit hard. With economic reopening gaining traction, now is the time for them to flourish on beaten-down valuation. Plus, downbeat earnings of a few technology behemoths may weigh on the tech-heavy Nasdaq ETF investing.
Growth stocks staged a comeback this year on hopes of a less-hawkish Fed. In comparison, value ETFs underperformed. But value ETFs are available at dirt-cheap valuation currently. SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF SPYV has a P/E ratio of 16.16X while SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF SPYG has a P/E ratio of 19.67X.
Below we have highlighted a few value ETFs that are cheap and may make a rebound if growth stocks’ rally falters and slowdown worries hit the global economy hard. These ETFs have a lower P/E than the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), i.e., 17.86X.

"FEB 1, 2024 7:47AM EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/daily-markets-powell-signals-no-go-in-march-apple-amazon-earnings,"Today’s Big Picture
Asia-Pacific equity markets finished the day mixed as those markets absorbed both yesterday’s Fed comments on the path of interest rates and China’s market stabilization efforts. China’s Shanghai Composite shed 0.64%, Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.76%, and Australia’s ASX All Ordinaries closed 1.19% lower in a broad decline led by Electronic Technology, and Transportation names. Taiwan’s TAIEX rose 0.44%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.52%, India’s SENSEX gained 0.61%, and South Korea’s KOSPI advanced 1.82% in a broad rally that saw Commercial Services as the only sector to close lower. Major European markets are lower in midday trading and U.S. equity futures are pointing to a higher open.
Following Fed Chair Powell’s comments yesterday the Fed needs to see further confirmation inflation is on a sustainable path to its 2% target, investors will pay close attention to fresh data out this morning that includes 4Q 2023 Productivity & Unit Labor Cost, S&P Global’s final U.S. Manufacturing PMI for January and ISM’s January Manufacturing Index. In that mix of data, the market will be looking to determine not only whether inflation continued to cool on a year over year basis but also if the economy is weakening enough that it could get the Fed to initiate its rate-cutting cycle sooner than later. These potential answers will come soon after today’s market open when S&P publishes its final January Manufacturing PMI at 9:45 AM ET with ISM’s to follow at 10 AM ET.
Market and Fed watchers will also gather comments from those reports about job creation as they prepare for tomorrow’s January Employment Report and get ready for Big Tech earnings to continue. After today’s market close, Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META), will report their December quarter results.

International Economy
The au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing PMI was at 48.0 in January, unrevised from flash data and slightly better than December’s 10-month low of 47.9. New work shrank for the 8th month, and export sales were also lower amid falling demand from China and the Asia-Pacific region.
The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI unexpectedly was at 50.8 in January, the same as December's figure but above market forecasts of 50.6. It was the third straight month of growth in factory activity, contrasting with official data that showed an extended weakness ahead of a Lunar New Year celebration. However, new orders grew the least since October.
The HCOB Eurozone Manufacturing PMI rose to 46.6 in January, the highest in ten months and in line with preliminary estimates. New orders and output indices both increased by over two points during the month, still contracting but at the slowest rates in nine months.
The S&P Global UK Manufacturing PMI was revised lower to 47 in January, down from the preliminary estimate of 47.3. Manufacturers also faced challenges in their supply chains due to the Red Sea crisis, which forced input deliveries to be redirected from the Suez Canal.
The flash reading indicated the inflation rate in the Euro Area inched lower to 2.8% YoY in January 2024 from December’s 2.9%, in line with market expectations. The flash data also found annual core inflation rate in the Euro Area, excluding volatile food and energy prices, eased for the 6th straight month to 3.3% in January the lowest since March 2022, and down from 3.4% in the prior month.
The Bank of England left interest rates unchanged following today’s monetary policy meeting.
Domestic Economy
In addition to this morning’s bout of January PMI data, we have the usual weekly jobless claims data and natural gas inventory figures out later this morning. We also have the December Construction Spending report, which should show nonresidential construction continuing to benefit from infrastructure and other stimulus spending.

"February 01, 2024 — 07:31 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stocks-climb-before-the-open-as-investors-await-u.s.-economic-data-and-more-big-tech,"March S&P 500 E-Mini futures (ESH24) are up +0.38%, and March Nasdaq 100 E-Mini futures (NQH24) are up +0.57% this morning as investors looked ahead to a new round of U.S. economic data and earnings reports from tech behemoths Apple, Amazon, and Meta Platforms.
As widely expected, the Federal Reserve kept its federal funds rate target range unchanged at 5.25%-5.50% for the fourth straight meeting on Wednesday. Although the Federal Open Market Committee removed its tightening bias from its statement, it’s in no rush to reduce rates. “The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” the Fed said in its monetary policy statement on Wednesday. In addition, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he doesn’t expect the Fed to deliver its first interest-rate cut in March, emphasizing the need for the central bank to proceed “carefully.” “I don’t think it’s likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to [cut], but that’s to be seen,” Powell said during the post-meeting press conference.
“Although the Fed softened some of its hawkish language, they also suggested it wasn’t yet clear that inflation was entirely under control. As usual, they said they’d let the economic data dictate their course. For a while, the debate has been about whether the market is too optimistic about a March rate cut. Inflation has been a little stickier than expected lately, and the labor market has mostly continued to surprise to the upside,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.
In Wednesday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major indices ended in the red, with the benchmark S&P 500 falling to a 1-week low and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropping to a 1-1/2 week low. Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK) tumbled over -17% after the industrial technology company posted downbeat Q1 results and lowered its full-year EPS outlook. Also, Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) slumped more than -7% and was the top percentage loser on the Nasdaq 100 after the Google parent reported weaker-than-expected Q4 ad revenue and projected higher AI-related spending. In addition, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) fell over -2% after the U.S. chip designer issued below-consensus Q1 revenue guidance. On the bullish side, Boeing Co (BA) climbed more than +5% and was the top percentage gainer on the Dow after reporting a narrower-than-anticipated quarterly loss.
The ADP National Employment report on Wednesday showed private payrolls rose by 107K jobs in January, lower than the consensus figure of 145K and moderating from the 158K reading in December. Also, the U.S. Q4 employment cost index came in at +0.9% q/q, weaker than expectations of +1.0% q/q and the smallest pace of increase in 2-1/2 years. In addition, the U.S. Chicago PMI unexpectedly edged down to 46.0 in January, weaker than expectations of 48.0.
Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in a 35.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the next central bank meeting in March and a 93.6% chance of at least a 25 basis point rate cut at the conclusion of the Fed’s May meeting.
Fourth-quarter earnings season continues in full flow, and investors await new reports from big-name companies today, including Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META). Analysts estimate aggregate S&P 500 earnings to grow 6.1% year-over-year in Q4, compared with an expected rise of 4.7% at the end of the quarter, per LSEG.
On the economic data front, all eyes are focused on the U.S. ISM Manufacturing PMI in a couple of hours. Economists, on average, forecast that January ISM Manufacturing PMI will stand at 47.2, compared to the previous value of 47.4.
Also, investors will likely focus on the U.S. S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, which came in at 47.9 in December. Economists foresee the January figure to be 50.3.
U.S. Construction Spending data will come in today. Economists expect December’s figure to be +0.5% m/m, compared to the previous number of +0.4% m/m.
U.S. Unit Labor Costs and Nonfarm Productivity preliminary data will also be closely watched today. Economists forecast Q4 Unit Labor Costs to be at +1.3% q/q and Q4 Nonfarm Productivity to stand at +2.4% q/q.
U.S. Initial Jobless Claims data will be reported today as well. Economists estimate this figure to be 213K, compared to last week’s value of 214K.
In the bond markets, United States 10-year rates are at 3.949%, down -0.38%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 futures are down -0.24% this morning as investors digested a raft of economic data and corporate earnings while awaiting the Bank of England’s latest monetary policy decision. A survey indicated on Thursday that the Eurozone’s factory downturn eased for the third consecutive month in January. Separately, data released by Eurostat on Thursday revealed that Eurozone headline inflation eased in line with expectations last month, but underlying price pressures declined less than anticipated. Meanwhile, the focus now shifts to the interest rate decision from the BOE due later in the session. The BOE is anticipated to maintain the bank rate at 5.25%, with attention centered on indications about the potential timing of future interest-rate cuts. In corporate news, Adidas Ag (ADS.D.DX) slumped over -5% after the German sportswear maker provided weaker-than-expected full-year profit guidance.

Asian stock markets today closed in the red. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -0.64% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -0.76%.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed lower today due to continued concerns about the country’s economic outlook. Losses in real estate stocks led the overall market lower. A private-sector survey revealed on Thursday that China’s factory activity expanded in January, driven by steady output growth, improved logistics, and the first increase in new export orders since June. Separately, as indicated by a survey published on Thursday, new home prices in China experienced their most rapid monthly increase since August 2021, propelled by a slew of government support measures. Average prices in 100 cities increased for the fifth consecutive month, with the month-on-month gain in January reaching 0.15%, surpassing the 0.1% increase recorded in December. Meanwhile, China pledged to maintain the “necessary intensity” for government spending this year, including utilizing the central budget to bolster investment. “Fiscal expenditure in 2024 will keep up the necessary intensity,” said Li Xianzhong, head of the Treasury Department at the Ministry of Finance, during a briefing in Beijing on Thursday. The government will set a “reasonable” size for investment, said Vice Finance Minister Wang Dongwei at the same briefing.

"February 01, 2024 — 07:23 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/futures-climb-following-wall-st-selloff-after-fed-holds-rates-steady-0,"By Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian
Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Thursday, following a Wall Street selloff in the previous session as the Federal Reserve dashed hopes for early interest rate cuts, with the focus moving to economic data and Big Tech earnings scheduled for later in the day.
The S&P 500 .SPX and the tech-laden Nasdaq .IXIC on Wednesday notched their biggest one-day percentage declines since September and October, respectively, while the Dow .DJI saw its steepest decline in six weeks.
Keeping interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, the Fed reminded markets of its undeterred focus on battling inflation and smashed speculations of policy easing kicking off in March.
However, some market participants believe cooling consumer prices and steady economic growth were more important than the timing of the first interest rate cut. Markets are still pricing in some 140 basis points in Fed cuts this year, compared to the Fed's projections of 75 basis points.
""We remain confident that inflation will be low enough to spur the Fed to begin easing monetary policy at either its March or May meeting,"" said Preston Caldwell, chief U.S. economist for Morningstar Research Services LLC.
""We are still forecasting a total of 150 bps of cuts in 2024 and the federal funds rate to end the year at 3.75%–4%.""
Focus moves back to Big Tech earnings that would shed light on whether megacap stocks can sustain their recent rally, fueled by the hype around artificial intelligence and hopes of early rate cuts.
Apple's AAPL.OiPhone sales are expected to have seen the best growth in five quarters, but analysts see a tough year for the company in China, while investors will monitor whether Amazon.com AMZN.O can cash in on its delivery heft by boosting fee revenue from its ""Buy With Prime"" service.
Meta Platforms META.O is likely to see a muted impact from generative AI on its advertising business.
The three tech giants, up between 0.7% and 0.9% in premarket trading, will report earnings after the closing bell, a day after investors punished Alphabet GOOGL.O and Microsoft MSFT.O on mounting costs of developing generative AI-powered products.
On the data front, investors will keep an eye out for weekly jobless claims and manufacturing PMI readings scheduled throughout the day.
At 7:00 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 33 points, or 0.09%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 18.75 points, or 0.38%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 97 points, or 0.56%.
MerckMRK.N climbed 1.4% after the drug maker posted upbeat fourth-quarter results on strong sales of its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda, while Dow component HoneywellHON.O dropped 2.0% after the diversified industrial firm forecast a weak first-quarter profit.
Qualcomm QCOM.O fell 1.3% on concerns over Android sales in China, even though the chip maker forecast second-quarter profit slightly above estimates and in-line sales.
Tesla TSLA.O was up 1.6%. The EV maker will hold a shareholder vote to transfer its state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware.
New York Community Bancorp NYCB.N recovered 0.9% after Wednesday's 38% slide on a dividend cut and surprise loss.

China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed lower today due to continued concerns about the country’s economic outlook. Losses in real estate stocks led the overall market lower.

Separately, as indicated by a survey published on Thursday, new home prices in China experienced their most rapid monthly increase since August 2021, propelled by a slew of government support measures. Average prices in 100 cities increased for the fifth consecutive month, with the month-on-month gain in January reaching 0.15%, surpassing the 0.1% increase recorded in December.

"February 01, 2024 — 06:20 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-wisdomtree-u.s.-largecap-dividend-etf-dln-be-on-your-investing-radar-11,"The WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend ETF (DLN) was launched on 06/16/2006, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by Wisdomtree. It has amassed assets over $3.76 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Value
Large cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.
Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.
Costs
When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.28%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.40%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 19.60% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 3.59% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Jpmorgan Chase & Co (JPM).
The top 10 holdings account for about 26.62% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
DLN seeks to match the performance of the WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend Index before fees and expenses. The WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend Index is a fundamentally weighted index that measures the performance of the large-capitalization segment of the U.S. dividend-paying market.
The ETF has added roughly 1.28% so far this year and was up about 8.17% in the last one year (as of 02/01/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $58.89 and $67.92.
The ETF has a beta of 0.88 and standard deviation of 14.02% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 301 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, DLN is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.
The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has $52.23 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $107.03 billion. SCHD has an expense ratio of 0.06% and VTV charges 0.04%.
Bottom-Line
An increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

LONDON/SYDNEY, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Dazed share markets were trying to steady on Thursday as Chinese stocks eked out rare gains and investors stuck to bets for sizable cuts in U.S. interest rates even if the kick-off date might now be a little later than first hoped.
Europe's bourses 0#.INDEXE started in the red as traders hoped euro zone inflation data and a Bank of England interest rate decision due later would divert attention from what had been Wall Street's worst rout since September on Wednesday. .N
The Federal Reserve committee's decision to hold rates at 5.25-5.5% had been no surprise, but it emphasised that rates would not be cut until it had more confidence that inflation was truly beaten.
In a media conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell flatly stated a cut as early as March seemed unlikely, but also conceded that everyone on the committee was looking to ease this year.
""One of the more dovish aspects of Powell's remarks was the asymmetry on employment: strong employment gains won't necessarily forestall rate cuts, but weak employment gains would 'absolutely' hasten rate cuts,"" wrote analysts at JPMorgan.
""We are sticking with our call for a first cut in June, but after Powell's remarks it's not hard to see a configuration of employment and inflation data that gets the Committee cutting by May.""
Investors nudged up European bond yields - which move inverse to price - in early dealing but there was a long way to go with the Bank of England expected to keep UK rates on hold at 1200 GMT and euro area inflation data at 1300 GMT. GVD/EUR
Following Powell's comments, markets actually doubled down on a May Fed move, pricing in 32 basis points of cuts - implying a 100% probability of 25 basis points and some chance of a 50 basis-point easing.
""Barring a material weakening in economic activity, we believe the Fed will wait until closer to mid-year to begin its easing cycle with a 25 basis point rate cut,"" economists at PIMCO said.
""As for subsequent rate cuts, the Fed’s latest projections suggest a 25 bps cut at every other meeting"".
The possible Fed slippage pushed the dollar toward its loftiest level of the year against the top world currencies, including a 6-week peak against the euro although Sweden's crown played its part too as the Riksbank held rates again.
Investors also seemed to be wagering that the more the Fed delayed now, the more aggressive it would have to cut in the future given slowing inflation would sharply lift real rates.
As a result, Fed fund futures 0#FF: for December have priced in a further 11 basis points of easing this year taking the total expected to 141 basis points. FEDWATCH
Likewise, Treasuries rallied strongly as 10-year yields US10YT=RR dived 12 basis points to 3.91% in the wake of the Fed decision. Some of those gains were then pared in Europe, nudging yields up to 3.94%.
BANK JITTERS
The rush into bonds was further encouraged by renewed jitters over regional U.S. banks when New York Community BancorpNYCB.K crashed 37% to the lowest in over two decades after posting a surprise loss.
That spilled over into other bank stocks and contributed to a sharp 1.6% pullback in the S&P 500 late Wednesday, while the Nasdaq had already been pressured by falls from Google parent Alphabet GOOGL.O and Tesla TSLA.O. .N
Thursday saw a steadying though. S&P 500 futures ESc1 added 0.2%, while Nasdaq futures NQc1 firmed 0.4%. Markets face a major test later in the day with results out from tech giants Apple AAPL.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Meta META.O. RESF/US
The choppy trading had made Asian markets cautious overnight. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific .MIAP00000PUS ending down 0.4% although sentiment was helped by a stabilisation in Chinese blue chips .CSI300, along with some better surveys on home prices and manufacturing.
Japan's Nikkei .N225 eased 0.8% as the yen gained. South Korea .KS11 bounced 1.8% following upbeat trade data and a survey showing factory activity grew for the first time in 19 months.
Currency markets were jolted by the mixed reaction to the Fed, with the dollar gaining on the euro but losing to the yen as bond yields slid.
The euro was at $1.0787 EUR=EBS, after ending Wednesday down a slight 0.2%. The dollar held at 146.63 yen JPY=EBS, having fallen as far as 146.00 yen at one stage overnight. US/
Gold also gyrated in the wake of the Fed, and was last up 0.2% at $2,041 an ounce XAU=. GOL/
Oil prices pared some of the sharp losses suffered on Wednesday, as tensions in the Middle East helped offset concerns about oversupply and soft global demand. O/R
Brent futures LCOc1 edged up 27 cents to $80.82 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 rose 27 cents to $76.12 per barrel.

""We have pushed back our forecast of the first cut from March to May,"" said analysts at Goldman Sachs. ""However, we continue to expect 5 cuts in 2024 and 3 more in 2025 because we expect core inflation to fall at least a couple of tenths below the FOMC's median projection this year.""
Investors also seemed to be wagering that more the Fed delayed now, the more aggressive it would have to cut in the future given slowing inflation would sharply lift real rates.

"February 01, 2024 — 12:30 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/morning-bid-europe-for-markets-a-fed-delay-means-more-in-may,"A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.
As the dust settles on another Federal Reserve meeting, markets have lengthened the odds on a first rate cut in March only to double down on an easing in May.
It was a typically volatile reaction as the Fed statement dropped a tightening bias, as expected, but inserted a warning that cuts would not be ""appropriate"" until there was more confidence that inflation is heading back down to 2%.
In his news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell chose to be unusually specific in saying that a cut as early as March was unlikely. Fed futures duly reduced the probability of a March move to 34%, from 60% just before the announcement and 40% on Tuesday. FEDWATCH
Yet, Powell was also clear that the entire FOMC expected lower rates this year - it was just a matter of timing. Notably, a strong labour market would not derail the easing, he said, but the Fed would cut faster if employment weakened.
Such an asymmetric outlook only makes Friday's payrolls report all the more important, with any downside surprise likely to shift the market back to a March kickoff.
For now, futures are pricing in about 32 basis points of cuts for May - 25 bps plus some chance of 50 bps - and 141 basis points of easing for all of 2024.
If the Fed does delay until May and inflation keeps falling, as the doves reason, it will have to be more aggressive in easing to stop real rates from becoming punishingly restrictive.
Bond investors are clearly in the dovish camp, with two-year Treasury yields US2YT=RR now at 4.248% versus 4.359% late on Tuesday. Ten-year yields US10YT=RR edged up a little during Asia trade to 3.946%, but that is still down from Tuesday's 4.057%.
The rush to bonds was also encouraged by jitters over regional U.S. banks when New York Community BancorpNYCB.K shares crashed 37% to the lowest in more than two decades after posting a surprise loss.
The drop in yields pulled the dollar down on the yen to 146.70 JPY=EBS but didn't offer much help to the euro, at $1.0812 EUR=EBS, as markets are still wagering heavily on an early ECB easing.
Futures are almost fully priced for a first ECB cut in April and have 144 bps of cuts pencilled in for 2024. 0#ECBWATCH
The Bank of England holds its first meeting of the year later on Thursday and is certain to hold at 5.25%. Again, with inflation slowing faster than expected, markets want to hear concrete talk of cuts. That leaves them vulnerable to any official pushback.
The central bank also releases its quarterly outlook for the economy and the focus will be on forecasts for how quickly inflation is seen returning to the 2% target.
As for Wall Street, the main course will be results from Apple AAPL.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Meta META.O, with investors looking for better news after being disappointed by Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Tesla TSLA.O.
Key developments that could influence markets on Thursday:
- EU Dec CPI and unemployment rate; Global PMIs for Jan

"January 31, 2024 — 08:42 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/global-markets-asia-ponders-fed-fallout-bonds-still-bullish-on-rate-cuts,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Asian shares faltered on Thursday after Wall Street took a late spill, while investors stuck to bets for sizable cuts in U.S. interest rates this year even if the kick off might now be a little later than first hoped.
The Federal Reserve committee's decision to hold rates at 5.25-5.5% on Wednesday was no surprise, it took a dovish twist by emphasising that rates would not be cut until it had more confidence that inflation was truly beaten.
In a media conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell flatly stated a cut as early as March seemed unlikely, but also conceded that everyone on the committee was looking to ease this year.
""One of the more dovish aspects of Powell's remarks was the asymmetry on employment: strong employment gains won't necessarily forestall rate cuts, but weak employment gains would 'absolutely' hasten rate cuts,"" wrote analysts at JPMorgan.
""We are sticking with our call for a first cut in June, but after Powell's remarks it's not hard to see a configuration of employment and inflation data that gets the Committee cutting by May.""
Indeed, markets actually doubled down on a May move, pricing in 32 basis points of cuts - implying a 100% probability of 25 basis points and some chance of a 50 basis-point easing.
""We have pushed back our forecast of the first cut from March to May,"" said analysts at Goldman Sachs. ""However, we continue to expect 5 cuts in 2024 and 3 more in 2025 because we expect core inflation to fall at least a couple of tenths below the FOMC's median projection this year.""
Investors also seemed to be wagering that more the Fed delayed now, the more aggressive it would have to cut in the future given slowing inflation would sharply lift real rates.
As a result, Fed fund futures 0#FF: for December have priced in a further 13 basis points of easing this year taking the total expected to 143 basis points. FEDWATCH
Likewise, Treasuries rallied strongly as 10-year yields US10YT=RR dived 12 basis points to 3.91% in the wake of the Fed decision. Some of those gains were then pared in Asia, nudging yields up to 3.950%.
BANK JITTERS
The rush into bonds was further encouraged by renewed jitters over regional U.S. banks when New York Community BancorpNYCB.K crashed 37% to the lowest in over two decades after posting a surprise loss.
That spilled over into other bank stocks and contributed to a sharp pullback in the S&P 500 late Wednesday, while the Nasdaq had already been pressured by falls in Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Tesla TSLA.O. .N
By early Thursday, sentiment had steadied and S&P 500 futures ESc1 added 0.2%, while Nasdaq futures NQc1 firmed 0.3%. The market faces a major test later in the day when results are out from Apple AAPL.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Meta META.O. RESF/US
The choppy trading left Asian markets cautious and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dipped 0.3%.
Japan's Nikkei .N225 eased 0.5% as the yen gained, while South Korea .KS11 bounced 0.7% as a survey showed factory activity growing for the first time in 19 months.
Chinese blue chips .CSI300 eased 0.4%, still smarting from a disappointing January factory survey.
Currency markets were jolted by the mixed reaction to the Fed, with the dollar gaining on the euro but losing to the yen as bond yields slid.
The euro was left at $1.0805 EUR=EBS, after ending Wednesday down a slight 0.2%. The dollar was holding at 146.86 yen JPY=EBS, having fallen as far as 146.00 at one stage overnight. US/
Gold also gyrated in the wake of the Fed, and was last up a fraction at $2,040 an ounce XAU=. GOL/
Oil prices were near flat, having retreated on Wednesday amid worries about demand from China and a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories. O/R
Brent futures LCOc1 edged up 12 cents to $80.67 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 rose 10 cents to $75.95 per barrel.

"January 31, 2024 — 07:39 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/q4-earnings%3A-tech-flexes-strong-growth,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>
Here are the key points:
 Total Q4 earnings for the 176 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +1.7% from the same period last year on +2.6% higher revenues, with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 69.3% beating revenue estimates.
  Looking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 index earnings are currently expected to be up +2.4% from the year-earlier level on +2.8% higher revenues, which would follow the +3.8% earnings growth in 2023 Q3 on +2.0% higher revenues.
 For the Tech sector, we now have Q4 results for 46.8% of the sector’s market capitalization in the index. Total earnings for these Tech companies are up +19.3% from the same period last year on +6.6% higher revenues, with 82.1% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.
 The Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Tech companies are notably tracking higher than what we have seen from these companies in other recent periods, though the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking modestly below other recent periods and the 20-quarter average. 
The market’s darling mega-cap Tech companies that we have been referring to as the ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ and everyone else as ‘Magnificent 7’, or ‘Mag 7’ for short, have started reporting results, with Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA now out with their December-quarter results. The still-to-come reports from this exalted club are comprised of Amazon AMZN, META META, Apple AAPL, and Nvidia NVDA.
Total Q4 earnings for the ‘Mag 7’ (we have thrown in the towel and will be referring to the group by the same name) are expected to be up +41.3% from the same period last year on +13% higher revenues, which would follow the group’s +54.2% higher earnings on +12.9% higher revenues in 2023 Q3.
You can see the group’s earnings and revenue growth picture in the chart below.

Concerning the market reactions to the Microsoft and Alphabet results, both of these stocks had climbed significantly heading into the releases, on top of last year’s impressive gains, suggesting that a sell-the-news type of reaction was the most likely outcome. Microsoft's results were relatively more impressive than Alphabet’s numbers, but both companies came out with solid results.
Microsoft’s Q4 earnings were up +25.9% on +17.6% higher revenues, while the same for Alphabet were up +51.8% on +14.6% higher revenues. Both companies came out with cloud revenues that represented acceleration over the preceding period, with Microsoft’s cloud revenues up +30% from the same period last year and Alphabet’s relatively smaller cloud business enjoying revenue growth of +26%.
The market’s issue with the Alphabet report is related to the company’s core ad business, which showed lower-than-expected growth of +11%.
The market reactions to these results notwithstanding, for companies the size of Microsoft and Alphabet to be able to achieve this magnitude of top- and bottom-line gains in this macro backdrop speaks to their enormous earnings power.
The chart below shows the group’s growth picture on an annual basis.

Beyond the Mag 7, Q4 earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +2.4% above the year-earlier period on +2.8% higher revenues. This would follow the +3.8% increase in index earnings in 2023 Q3 on +2.3% higher revenues.
The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a quarterly basis.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
As you can see from these quarterly earnings-growth expectations, the growth picture is expected to steadily improve over the next few quarters.
Below, we show the overall earnings picture for the S&P 500 index on an annual basis.

Given the expected moderation in the U.S. economy’s growth trajectory due to the cumulative effects of Fed tightening, these estimates likely need to come down. Some of that downward adjustment is already happening, as seen in the chart below.

As we have noted before, full-year 2024 estimates started coming down in October, with the trend continuing in November and early December, but appear to have stabilized in recent weeks.

The positive outlook for the U.S. economy is underlined by robust growth, with a 3.3% increase last year, outpacing the average pre-pandemic growth. Despite interest rates reaching their highest levels in over two decades, the economy remains resilient, boasting a historically low unemployment rate of 3.7%. The Federal Reserve’s potential rate cuts are seen as a precautionary measure to sustain the strong growth momentum and avoid any risks of over-tightening, indicating a careful and strategic approach to economic management. The economy is booming, and now is the time to take advantage. Buy these top wealth-building stocks for 2024.
Palo Alto Networks (PANW)

Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is an American cybersecurity company offering firewalls and other cloud-based products aimed at the utmost protection of its users. The stock has a value of $345.89, 118% more than last year.
PANW is in the global cybersecurity, an industry already valuable but one that hasn’t even started reaching its ceiling yet. That is evidenced by its valuation of $203.45 billion in 2022 and its estimation to reach $660.67 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 15.9%.
PANW ‘s revenue growth came in at 23.89%, representing 315.65% from the sector median. EBITDA Growth (YoY) was also impressive, reaching 498.17%, a remarkable 15,108.49% more than the sector average. Profitability-wise, the Gross Profit Margin (TTM) was 73.35%, 48.43% more than the sector average. Price/Sales (TTM) was 396.14% more than the sector, further showing this stock is growing on all frontiers while remaining incredibly profitable.
Palo Alto Networks has continued its relentless AI push, upgrading the threat analytics platform with generative artificial intelligence tools. That changes the industry completely, adding a whole new dimension to cybersecurity. As PANW continues experimenting and innovating with AI, it will remain profitable. Betting against this stock could be disastrous, so I give it a Buy rating and fully expect it to continue its breakout throughout 2024.
Stanley Black & Decker (SWK)

Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) is an American manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and a provider of security products.
SWK reported a TTM operating margin of 5.95%, with revenue reaching $16.03 billion. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has fluctuated between a high of $104.21 and a low of $73.12. Notably, the stock has shown a positive trend, posting an 11% increase in value over the past year.
SWK’s growth catalyst lies in DEWALT POWERSHIFT™, an electrified line of heavy-duty tools for concrete job sites. Responding to the industry’s shift towards electric-powered equipment, this innovation allows users to transition from gas-powered tools without sacrificing efficiency. With a focus on sustainability and user advantages, particularly in response to legislative changes, the strategic move positions the company for substantial growth potential, likely impacting its stock price positively.
With solid plans and a strong monopoly in this field, SWK should have strong growth this year.
Apple (AAPL)

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest technological developer and producer in the American industry, creating the most-sold cellular phone of 2023 — the iPhone. Valued at $188.04, AAPL faced strong YoY valuation growth in 2023, with the stock increasing 48%.
The technology industry is one already established in modern consumerism, with annual revenue expectations of 1.4 trillion in 2024. Projected to increase to $1.8 trillion in 2028, the industry has been labeled with a 6.75% CAGR for that duration. Apple, granted the largest tech-related market cap, holds a value of $2.99 trillion globally.
In 2023, the company reported a similar year to 2022, though it outcompeted key income metrics. Starting with revenue, Apple brought in a total of $383.3 billion, a slight decline from the year prior’s $394.3 billion. Despite the slight decline in performance, Apple consistently outperformed industry forecasts in revenue. Looking to net income in Q3 ‘23, Apple brought in $22.96 billion, or a 10.79% YoY growth. With additional net profit margins increasing, AAPL reported an overall positive financial performance.
Expect AAPL revenue to take a boost in the upcoming quarter as a result of the all-new Apple Vision Pro, a spacial computing headset using virtual reality as a computer. Reaching a virtually untapped market, Apple has innovated a product with no industry competitors at the moment. Along with Apple integration and computing power, the tech company has developed a device that creates its own market. As AAPL shapes the market for this device, expect revenue to increase through the new source of income, as well as taking partial sales from the expansive virtual reality industry.

"January 31, 2024 — 06:08 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/powell-dubious-on-march-cut-markets-slide,"Markets pulled back from their steady trading levels today — three of which were in the red all session; only the Dow kept its head above water through the morning — once Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking at his press conference following the latest Fed meeting, expressed he was agnostic about a March rate cut. Indices jumped higher on the Fed’s release initially, but in terms of forecasting a March move lower than the current 5.25-5.50% interest rate levels, Powell said that this was “not the most-likely case.”

The Dow came down -317 points on the session, -0.82%, while the S&P 500 doubled this loss, -1.61%. The Nasdaq, after riding high just a couple short days ago, shed -345 points today, -2.23%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 took out the floor among the major indices on the Fed news, -2.45%. Of these, only the Russell has dipped back into negative territory year to date, but only the Dow is still higher after the past week of trading.

Overall, Powell was quite optimistic about the general state of things: “This is a good economy,” he said. The Fed’s interests continue to be to “finish the job on inflation while keeping labor markets strong.” He did mention a couple times that a new dot-plot was in the works, and would be forthcoming at the Fed’s next meeting, which is not until March 19-20. Until then, the Fed will have plenty of data to sift through on PCE, CPI and jobs numbers, etc., so those wringing their hands about Powell’s cool attitude toward a March cut should not give into despair just yet.

The reason is right there in this morning’s ADP ADP private-sector payroll report, which tallied the third lowest month in the past year, 107K, and notched the sixth-straight sub-200K print on private-sector jobs. Should this — as well as the U.S. government’s non-farm payroll report, which comes out Friday morning — slip to sub-100K or thereabouts over the next two months, this could be a real sign that the economy is slipping further, and rate cuts at that time might be warranted to better ensure the “soft landing” we’ve been crossing our fingers for over the past year.

Qualcomm QCOM is the latest major company to report earnings after the bell today, with fiscal Q1 earnings of $2.75 per share easily surpassing the $2.38 in the Zacks consensus (and $2.37 per share in the year-ago quarter). Revenues were also strongly ahead of estimates: $9.92 billion from the anticipated $9.50 billion. However, guidance for Q2 is down on both top sand bottom lines. Chip sales in the reported quarter were +7% overall, including a +31% jump in its fledgling auto business. Shares have been bouncing around in late trading.

Tomorrow morning brings us a fresh litany of economic reports, from Initial and Continuing Jobless Claims to S&P and ISM Manufacturing, U.S. Q4 Productivity, Construction and Auto Sales. For quarterly earnings reports, we’ll hear from Merck MRK and Royal Caribbean RCL, among others. Tomorrow after the close is another marquee triple-bill: Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META. Of these, Amazon looks to take out easy earnings comps by a whopping +285%, while on the top line, Meta is expected to make gains of +21%.

"January 31, 2024 — 04:08 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qualcomm-forecasts-quarterly-profit-above-estimates-shares-rise,"By Stephen Nellis
Jan 31 (Reuters) - Qualcomm QCOM.O on Wednesday forecast fiscal second-quarter profit slightly above Wall Street estimates and sales in line with market expectations, as a new line of AI-enabled chips helps power it out of last year's smartphone slump.
Qualcomm predicted sales and adjusted profit with a midpoint of $9.30 billion and $2.30 per share for the current fiscal second quarter ending in March. The outlook compares with analyst estimates of $9.30 billion and $2.25 per share, according to data from LSEG.
Qualcomm shares were up 2.4% in after-hours trading after the results. In addition to the results, the company said on Wednesday it has reached a chip supply deal with Samsung to supply chips globally for its top-end Galaxy S24 model.
Qualcomm is the biggest supplier of chips to a smartphone market that had its worst sales year in a decade in 2023. As the smartphone industry slowly recovers, Qualcomm is facing competition on multiple fronts, with Huawei HWT.UL and Samsung Electronics 005930.KS both selling phones powered by in-house chips and Taiwan's MediaTek 2454.TW challenging Qualcomm's stronghold in mid- and premium-tier Android phones.
But the San Diego, California, company last year renewed a chip supply deal with Apple AAPL.O. It is also expanding into other markets such as personal computers, with partners such as Dell Technologies DELL.N and Lenovo Group 0992.HK expected to debut laptops with chips that Qualcomm claims are faster than Apple's in-house processors.
For the fiscal first quarter ended on Dec. 24, Qualcomm reported sales and adjusted profit of $9.94 billion and $2.75 per share, above estimates of $9.52 billion and $2.37 per share, according to LSEG data.
In Qualcomm's chip segment, the company forecast fiscal second-quarter sales with a midpoint of $7.9 billion, above analyst estimates of $7.86 billion. Qualcomm predicted second- quarter sales with a midpoint of $1.3 billion in its patent-licensing business, in line with estimates of $1.3 billion.
For the just-ended fiscal first quarter, Qualcomm said chip and licensing revenues were $8.42 billion and $1.46 billion, respectively, above/below analyst estimates of $7.99 billion and $1.41 billion, according to LSEG data.
Within its chip business, Qualcomm said that mobile handsets generated $6.69 billion in sales in the first quarter, above estimates of $6.37 billion, according to data from Visible Alpha. Automotive and Internet-of-Things chip revenues in the first quarter were $598 million and $1.14 billion, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of $518.3 million and $1.22 billion.

The company is reportedly viewing this year's update as one of the most significant in its history, with a wide range of new features and improvements being introduced.
According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple views this year's upcoming iOS 18 software release as ""One of the biggest iOS updates — if not the biggest — in the company's history.""
Initially, work on new features for iOS 18 was paused in November due to bug issues, but Apple is now set to unveil the update at WWDC 2024 in June. Following this, a beta testing version will be released in June, while the general public can expect to access the update in September.
One of the most exciting new features of iOS 18 is an enhanced Siri that will adopt elements of current Large Language Models like ChatGPT. Moreover, generative AI will be integrated into various apps like Messages, Apple Music, Keynote, and Pages, to provide auto-complete responses and playlists, as well as generative drafting.
Another noteworthy addition to iOS 18 is the introduction of Rich Communication Services (RCS) support. This will bring iMessage-style features to texts between iPhone and Android users, including read receipts, typing indicators, and support for sending high-quality images and videos. RCS can work over mobile data or Wi-Fi, making it a highly convenient feature for users.

"January 31, 2024 — 01:07 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meta-q4-earnings-preview%3A-does-zuckerberg-have-a-plan-to-take-meta-stock-higher,"This Thursday should be a busy day for investors, as three trillion-dollar giants – Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) - will release their quarterly earnings after the bell. Last year's performance for Meta stock was remarkable, and with gains of 194%, 2023 marked its best-ever annual return. The gains came after a dismal 2022, when the shares lost around two-thirds of their value and suffered their worst-ever year amid a broader tech sell-off.
After Meta reported a YoY decline in its 2022 revenues – its first as a public company – CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 as the company's “year of efficiency.” Markets gave a thumbs-up to the company’s aggressive cost cuts, and the stock not only outperformed its FAANG peers by a wide margin, but was also the second-best performing S&P 500 Index ($SPX) stock of 2023 - behind only Nvidia (NVDA), which rode the artificial intelligence (AI) wave to become the first trillion-dollar chip designer last year.
In today's session, as investors brace for a flurry of tech earnings on Thursday, both Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) are trading lower after their respective quarterly reports, which failed to please markets despite the beat on headline metrics. Here’s what Wall Street expects from Meta’s Q4 earnings, and whether Zuckerberg might have a new ace in his sleeve, as the “year of efficiency” narrative might have run its course.
Meta Q4 Earnings Preview
Analysts expect Meta to post revenues of $39.17 billion in Q4 – 21.8% higher than the corresponding quarter last year. During their Q3 earnings call, Meta said that it expects to post revenues between $36.5 billion to $40 billion in Q4 - which, at the midpoint, was below the $38.9 billion that analysts expected. Also, the guidance range was wider than usual, which the company’s CFO Susan Li attributed to “more volatility” since the beginning of Q4, coinciding with the start of the Israel-Hamas war.
On average, analysts expect Meta’s earnings per share to rise 61.3% in Q4, as the company’s aggressive cost cuts continue to flow to its bottom line.

Apart from the headline numbers, Meta’s comments on the Q1 outlook will be critical, since the stock fell after the Q3 earnings release as its guidance spooked investors. Also, I would watch for the commentary on losses in the company’s Reality Labs segment, which is building the metaverse. 
While Zuckerberg has touted the metaverse as critical to the company’s long-term growth, the business has been plagued by persistent losses that have eaten into the hefty profits that its core advertising business generates.
Analysts Are Bullish on Meta Heading into Q4 Report
Wall Street analysts are bullish on Meta stock heading into the Q4 report, and KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson raised his target price on the stock to $465 - just shy of the Street-high target price of $470. Evercore ISI and BofA are also bullish on Meta stock heading into the earnings report.
The overall analyst sentiment toward Meta stock is quite positive,, with a “Strong Buy” or “Buy” rating from over 90% of those in coverage. Currently, META is the second highest-rated FAANG stock behind Amazon.
www.barchart.com
Amid the recent rise in Meta shares – it recently rejoined the $1 trillion club – the stock trades marginally above its mean target price. We could see more analysts raise their target price on Meta following the Q4 report, as has been the case for the last few earnings calls.
What Could Drive the Next Leg of Meta's Rally?
Cost cuts helped fuel a rally in Meta stock last year. Along with the rise in earnings, the rally in Meta stock was also driven by an expansion of its valuation multiples, with the next 12-month price-to-earnings multiple gradually rising to 23.1x - which is slightly higher than the average multiple for the last five years.
While Meta is still the cheapest FAANG stock based on the metric, it has historically traded at a discount to its tech peers. I believe Meta might need more pathbreaking steps like the 2023 cost cuts to support the next leg of its rally. AI is one venture that could help drive growth for Meta. Indeed, the company does see AI as a key short-term driver, and while Zuckerberg did not specifically term 2024 as the “year of AI,” the overall tone of the Q3 earnings call seemed to suggest as much.
The metaverse could be another driver, but the business is still years from monetization - and in the meantime, continues to drag down the company’s overall profitability. I would watch Meta’s Q4earnings callfor comments on how the Zuckerberg-led company plans to keep bulls in good spirits after the remarkable progress in 2023 as part of the “year of efficiency.”

"January 31, 2024 — 12:24 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-weeks-must-see-earnings-charts-1,"Earnings season steps it up a notch this week as over 400 companies are expected to report earnings. Many of them are large cap growth stocks, including several Magnificent 7 stocks like Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms.
But the Mag 7 aren’t the only stocks hitting new highs. There are plenty of other companies doing so as well, including some of the top growth stocks on the Street. We’re going to get earnings reports from these companies as well.
Can They Beat Again?
It’s difficult to have a perfect earnings surprise track record. But even one or two misses, over the last 5 years, is a tremendous earnings surprise record because that time period included the pandemic.
Companies had to navigate government lockdowns and a spooked consumer. But these 5 have come out of it and are looking beyond the pandemic now.
Can they beat and move higher?
5 Must-See Earnings Charts
1.    Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO)
Tractor Supply has only missed 4 times on earnings over the last 5 years but two of those misses were in 2023. However, it’s coming off of a beat last quarter.
Shares of Tractor Supply have rallied 19.1% over the last 3 months but are up just 1.6% over the last year. It trades with a forward P/E of 22 as the shares have stalled.
Should Tractor Supply be on your short list?
2.    Apple Inc. (AAPL)
Apple has a great earnings surprise track record. It has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2023.
Shares of Apple are up 31.5% in the last year and are hitting new all-time highs. It’s not cheap. Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.8.
Will Apple’s report be a catalyst for even more new highs?
3.    Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)
Amazon.com has beat big over the last 4 quarters but had 3 misses prior to that time, in 2022.
Shares of Amazon.com are up 60.4% over the last year and are hitting new multi-year highs, but are not yet back to all-time highs. It’s not cheap, with a P/E of 43 but Amazon.com trades with a P/S ratio of just 3.0.
Should Amazon.com be on your short list?
4.    Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)
Meta Platforms has beat 4 quarters in a row. But the real story is the turnaround in the shares, which have skyrocketed 114% over the last year to new all-time highs.
Meta Platforms has attractive valuations at a forward P/E of just 22.3.
Is Meta Platforms too hot to handle in 2024?
5.    Deckers Outdoor Corp. (DECK)
Deckers has two of the hottest shoe brands in UGG and Hoka. It also has a hot earnings surprise chart as it has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2021.
Shares of Deckers have soared 84% in the last year and are trading at new all-time highs. It’s not as cheap as it used to be, with a forward P/E of 32.
Is Deckers too hot to handle in 2024?

Chipmaker AMD down on dour Q1 rev forecast
New York Community Bancorp's surprise loss drags regional banks
Boeing defers 2024 outlook, CEO says co has 'much to prove'
Fed expected to stay put on rates; decision at 2:00 p.m. ET
Indexes: Dow up 0.06%, S&P down 0.84%, Nasdaq off 1.46%
Updated at 11:36 a.m. ET/1636 GMT
By Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian
Jan 31 (Reuters) - The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled to over a week low on Wednesday, as Alphabet's projections for rising AI costs dented most megacap and chip stocks ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve policy decision expected later in the day.
The Google-parent GOOGL.O slumped 6.1%, pushing the S&P 500 communication services sector .SPLRCL 3.0% lower, after reporting holiday-season advertising sales below expectations and projecting higher AI-related spending.
Microsoft MSFT.O also lost 1.3% after it forecast higher costs to develop new artificial-intelligence features, which overshadowed its upbeat quarterly results.
Even though the tech pioneers talked up how customers are lapping up their generative AI-powered products, mounting development costs for the cutting-edge features irked investors who had hoped for a big boost to sales from the new technology.
The tech results and forecasts, coupled with Tesla's TSLA.O growth warning last week, have prompted renewed focus on risks from the outsized weighting of the megacap names in the S&P 500 that has hit record highs in recent weeks.
Apple AAPL.O, Meta Platforms META.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O, set to report earnings on Thursday, fell over 1% each.
Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O dropped 3.3%, as the chipmaker's first-quarter revenue forecast and a boosted projection for AI processors failed to meet expectations.
Other chip stocks including Nvidia NVDA.O, Broadcom AVGO.O and Marvell Technology MRVL.O dropped over 1% each.
New York Community Bancorp NYCB.N slumped 35.8% after swinging to surprise loss and slashing its dividend, driving the KBW Regional Banking index .KRX down 3.7%.
Supporting the blue-chip Dow, Boeing BA.N rose 5.8% following narrower-than-expected quarterly loss, though the plane maker delayed annual financial and delivery forecasts.
The focus was now on the Fed's first monetary policy decision this year, at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady. But any clues from it on the first cut could help determine the fate of the heavily weighted tech and tech-adjacent stocks.
""The critical point is with economic data being stronger, there's less of an excuse for the Fed to be pushing towards deeper accommodation and more aggressive rate cuts,"" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group.
The latest ADP National Employment report showed private payrolls rose by 107,000 in January, far less than the estimated 145,000 increment, a day after a JOLTS report reflected an unexpected rise in December job openings.
At 11:36 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 23.49 points, or 0.06%, at 38,490.80, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 41.34 points, or 0.84%, at 4,883.63, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 225.96 points, or 1.46%, at 15,283.94.15,283.94
Among others, Tesla shed 0.8% after a Delaware judge tossed out Elon Musk's record-breaking $56 billion Tesla pay package.
Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO.N dropped 3.4% after the medical equipment maker forecast annual profit below estimates.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.24-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.39-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P recorded 59 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 58 new highs and 74 new lows.

Visa (V)

The stock of Visa (NYSE:V) is trending upwards after the credit card giant issued fourth quarter 2023 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts. The company, which operates the world’s biggest payments network, reported Q4 earnings per share (EPS) of $2.41, topping analyst estimates of $2.34. Revenue amounted to $8.60 billion, up more than 9% from a year earlier and ahead of forecasts that called for $8.50 billion in sales.
In terms of forward guidance, Visa said that it expects revenue growth in the current first quarter of 2024 in the upper-mid to high-single digits and profit growth in the high-teens. The payments company continues to benefit from strong consumer spending and retail sales. Its payment volumes, which cover the holiday shopping season, rose 8% in Q4 2023, while cross-border volumes increased 16%. The company’s total transactions for Q4 2023 rose 9% to $57.50 billion.
V stock is up 7% so far in 2024 and has gained 21% in the last 12 months.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com
The stock of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is on a tear currently and has achieved an important milestone. For the first time ever, Microsoft’s market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable publicly traded company and becoming only the second concern in history to achieve a $3 trillion market cap, besting rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the process. On Jan. 25, MSFT stock finished trading with a market valuation of $3.009 trillion, slightly ahead of Apple at $3.002 trillion.
The $3 trillion milestone comes four years after Microsoft first reached a $1 trillion market cap, back in April 2019. Microsoft has been a publicly traded company since 1986. The company’s market value reached $2 trillion in June 2021, and has now topped $3 trillion. The new milestone was reached as MSFT stock has gained 11% so far in 2024, bringing its 12-month increase to 69%. The company’s stock continues to rally higher on investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI).
American Airlines (AAL)
Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com
After four bruising years, airline stocks look to be making a comeback, led by American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). The stock of the world’s largest airline is up 9% year to date, driven higher after the carrier announced better-than-expected Q4 2023 financial results and offered a bullish outlook for the year ahead. American Airlines posted Q4 EPS of 29 cents on revenue of $13.10 billion. Wall Street had expected a profit of 11 cents on sales of $13 billion.
While the Q4 numbers were impressive, so too was the guidance issued by American Airlines. The company said that it expects to report earnings of $2.25 to $3.25 a share for all of 2024. Analysts who were polled by FactSet expected full-year earnings of $2.14 a share. The airline said that it continues to benefit from strength in air travel coming out of the pandemic, including record bookings over the recent year-end holidays.
Procter & Gamble (PG)
Source: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com
The share price of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is up 5% early in the year as the consumer-goods company continues to demonstrate that it has pricing power and consumer loyalty on its side. Procter & Gamble, whose products include Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razor blades, reported Q4 2023 EPS of $1.84 versus $1.70 that had been forecast among analysts. Revenue totaled $21.44 billion versus $21.48 billion that had been expected. The company’s sales increased 3% from a year earlier.
In terms of guidance, Procter & Gamble said it anticipates fiscal 2024 earnings growth of 1%, down from a previous forecast of 6%. However, the company’s guidance tends to be conservative. Plus, Procter and Gamble expects its results to be impacted by a $1.3 billion charge related to a drop in the book value of its Gillette razor blade business as volume growth slows due to hybrid work trends. Still, PG stock is up 11% in the past year, making it a a good blue-chip stock to invest in.
IBM (IBM)
Source: shutterstock.com/LCV
Shares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) are red hot to start the year. The technology company’s stock has gained 16% in the month of January, bringing its 12 month increase to nearly 40%. The catalyst for the move higher was a strong Q4 financial print that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. IBM reported EPS of $3.87 versus $3.78 that was the consensus expectation of analysts. Revenue for the October through December quarter totaled $17.38 billion compared to $17.30 billion that had been forecast on Wall Street.
A deeper dive into the numbers, and IBM’s results look even better. Free cash flow for all of 2023 totaled $11.20 billion, more than the $10.50 billion that management had guided for. And the company’s Q4 gross margin of 59.1% was the highest since 1999. Perhaps best of all, the company said that its business related to generative AI was double the size it was in Q3 of last year. Looking ahead, IBM said that it expects $12 billion in free cash flow and revenue growth in the mid-single digits for 2024.
Charles Schwab (SCHW)

Bank stocks continue to struggle. However, a growing number of analysts are lending their support. Recently, analysts at Oppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) issued a note to clients arguing that stocks of banks and other financial services firms are “significantly undervalued,” ready to rebound, and that it’s time to buy. Among the stocks of financial institutions, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) looks particularly cheap with its share price down 15% in the last year and currently trading at 25 times future earnings estimates.
In January, Charles Schwab reported Q4 earnings that bested Wall Street forecasts even though its revenue and profits declined from a year earlier. The financial services firm announced Q4 EPS of 68 cents, which was ahead of consensus estimates that called for 64 cents. Revenue in the final quarter of 2023 totaled $4.45 billion, matching forecasts. Charles Schwab has struggled as high interest rates prompt customers to move money out of low-yielding accounts and into better paying money-market funds.
However, with inflation declining and interest rates on the cusp of being lowered, the year ahead should be kinder to SCHW stock.
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Pharmaceutical companies have had a difficult time over the past year. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), for one, has endured a rough road, particularly as it hived off its consumer health unit into a new company called Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE), the biggest change in the company’s 138-year history. In the last 12 months, JNJ stock has slumped 2%. In 2024, the shares are essentially flat. However, there are indications that better days are ahead for this stalwart blue-chip stock.
Recently, Johnson & Johnson issued better-than-expected Q4 earnings due largely to strong sales in its medical device business unit. The company announced EPS of $2.29 versus $2.28 that had been forecast on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $21.40 billion versus $21.01 billion that had been expected among analysts. Johnson & Johnson said the strong results were due largely to a 13.3% year-over-year increase in sales of its medical devices, which generated revenue of $7.67 billion in Q4. The company also continues to take steps to resolve accusations that its baby powder caused cancer in some people.

BENGALURU, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Wistron Corp 3231.TW has signed a non-binding agreement to invest 15 billion rupees ($180.7 million) in setting up a laptop manufacturing unit in the Indian state of Karnataka, the local government said on Wednesday.
The proposed plant is expected to create around 3,000 jobs and also produce electric vehicle-related parts, a statement from the government said.
Wistron plans to start manufacturing laptops at the plant from January 2026 and export more than half of the laptops made at the unit.
The deal comes months after Wistron approved sale of its unit that made Apple AAPL.O iPhones in the country to salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group in an estimated $125 million deal.
In November 2023, India granted incentives to companies like Dell DELL.N, HP HPQ.N and Foxconn 2317.TW to make IT hardware locally as part of its bid to become a powerhouse in the global electronics supply chain.
The south Indian state of Karnataka is being seen as a lucrative ground to set up manufacturing facilities as companies such as Foxconn look for ways to diversify away from China following COVID-19 disruptions and geopolitical tensions.

"January 31, 2024 — 10:23 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffett-led-berkshire-hathaways-%24371-billion-portfolio-owns-51-stocks-but-over-80,"Warren Buffett might have the all-time most extraordinary investment track record when all is said and done. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has beaten the S&P 500 by a wide margin for decades.
Berkshire is a holding company with dozens of private businesses and investments. However, investors follow the company's massive $371 billion stock portfolio the closest. Despite holding 51 stocks, just six make up over 80% of the portfolio's value. What does this mean, and how can investors apply Warren Buffett's wisdom to their investment strategy?
The sensational six and their history
Berkshire Hathaway, one of the world's largest corporations, has over 80% of its stock portfolio in just six companies. Here they are:
COMPANY POSITION SIZE (% OF BERKSHIRE PORTFOLIO)
Apple 47.5
Bank of America 9.3
American Express 8.2
Coca-Cola 6.4
Chevron 4.4
Occidental Petroleum 3.8
Data source: CNBC. Table by author.
While each stock has risen to the top of Berkshire's portfolio, they all have unique stories explaining how that came to be. Here's a look at each.
Apple: A big winner
Buffett first bought iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016. It's worked out very well for Berkshire. The stock has returned roughly 700% since the beginning of that year, with reinvested dividends along the way. That outsized return helps explain the stock's massive weighting in Berkshire's portfolio today.
Bank of America: Revisiting a past mistake
We all make mistakes. Berkshire bought Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) in 2007, just before the financial crisis. By 2010, Buffett had bailed on the bank's shares. However, he would eventually come back to the stock, building a new position starting a decade later. It's remained in the portfolio since and is Berkshire's second-largest holding today.
American Express and Coke: Buy and hold
Warren Buffett is famous for having a long-term mindset, reflected in his ownership of Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and American Express (NYSE: AXP). Berkshire bought these two stocks in 1988 and 1991, respectively, and has let them grow, repurchase shares, and pay dividends for decades. Given each company's brand recognition with consumers, it's hard to see Berkshire selling these stocks anytime soon, if ever at all.
Chevron and Occidental Petroleum: Long-term bets
Lastly, energy is a popular theme in Berkshire's business. The company owns private assets in oil and gas, including pipelines and utilities, but has also amassed large stakes in Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Buffett has bought most of the shares in these companies over the past four years as part of a bet on long-term oil prices, though he's sold some of Berkshire's Chevron stock over time.

Four essential takeaways for investors
No investor gets it right every time, even Buffett. Time will tell whether Berkshire's most significant holdings continue to perform, but Buffett's actions hint at his general investment philosophy. You shouldn't mindlessly copy his stock picks, but incorporating some of his beliefs can help you invest to the best of your ability.
1. Buy quality
Buffett is famous for saying that his No. 1 rule is never to lose money, and that his second rule is remembering the first one. Buffett has done very well investing in blue chip stocks at reasonable valuations, letting proven winners grow and create steady returns for investors. He doesn't chase speculative, unprofitable stocks. He embodies the tortoise, not the hare.
2. Think long term
Buffett has stated that a long time horizon is critical to successful investing. Berkshire doesn't always hold stocks for very long. However, recognizing and selling when you pick wrong is far different from selling an excellent investment to realize a profit. As Buffett has with Coca-Cola and American Express, you can hold the right stocks for decades.
3. Invest in durable industries
It's hard to invest for a long time if the companies you hold aren't around. You'll notice that Berkshire's portfolio focuses on the economy's fundamental pillars, like consumer spending, finances, and energy. These industries have been around for decades, even centuries. Disruptive growth stocks can add a spark to a diversified portfolio, but remember, they haven't proven their staying power yet.
4. Don't sell your winners
The size of Berkshire's Apple investment jumps off the page when you see it. It's for good reason. Berkshire's total Apple position is worth over $176 billion. That's an enormous amount of money for a single investment -- even for Buffett.
However, it didn't start that large. It's grown as the stock has appreciated so much over the past eight years. So why not sell? Buffett has stated that he believes Apple is better than any other business Berkshire owns. In other words, he doesn't want to sell it to buy something inferior.

US private payrolls miss expectations in January -ADP
Chipmaker AMD down on dour Q1 rev forecast
Boeing defers 2024 outlook, CEO says co has 'much to prove'
Fed expected to stay put on rates; decision at 2:00 p.m. ET
Indexes: Dow up 0.15%, S&P off 0.68%, Nasdaq down 1.33%

By Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian
Jan 31 (Reuters) - The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled to more than a week low on Wednesday, as Alphabet's projections for rising AI costs dented most megacap and chip stocks ahead of a crucial U.S. policy decision expected later in the day.
Alphabet GOOGL.O slumped 6.9%, pushing the S&P 500 communication services sector .SPLRCL 3.5% lower, after the company reported holiday-season advertising sales below expectations and projected higher spending this year on items such as servers to power artificial intelligence.
Microsoft MSFT.O also forecast higher costs to develop new artificial-intelligence features, but delivered upbeat quarterly results. The stock was down 0.5% in choppy trade.
Even though the tech pioneers talked up how customers are lapping up their generative AI-powered products, mounting development costs for the cutting-edge features irked investors hoping for a big boost to sales from the new technology.
""Definitely costs are playing on their minds, but also a lot of this is: will AI actually translate into profits and justify the valuations that these stocks have had or will AI become a fad,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments.
The tech results and forecasts, coupled with Tesla's TSLA.O growth warning last week, have prompted renewed focus on risks from the outsized weighting of the megacap names in the S&P 500 .SPX that have collectively pushed the benchmark index to record highs in recent weeks.
Apple AAPL.O, Meta Platforms META.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O, set to deliver their earnings on Thursday, fell between 1.6% and 2.3%.
Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O dropped 2.7%, as the chipmaker's first-quarter revenue forecast and a boosted projection for AI processors failed to meet expectations.
Other chip stocks Nvidia, Intel INTC.O, Broadcom AVGO.O and Marvell Technology MRVL.O declined between 0.2% and 1.8%.
Supporting the blue-chip Dow, Boeing BA.N rose 3.6% following upbeat results, though the plane maker delayed annual financial or delivery forecast.
The focus was now on the Federal Reserve's first monetary policy decision for this year, at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady.
Any hints on when the first rate cut might arrive could also help determine the fate of the heavily weighted tech and tech-adjacent stocks.
The ADP National Employment report showed private payrolls rose by 107,000 in January, far less than the estimated 145,000 increment, a day after the JOLTS report reflected an unexpected rise in December job openings.
At 9:48 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 56.62 points, or 0.15%, at 38,523.93, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 33.37 points, or 0.68%, at 4,891.60, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 205.83 points, or 1.33%, at 15,304.07.
Among others, Tesla shed 0.8% after a Delaware judge tossed out Elon Musk's record-breaking $56 billion Tesla pay package.
Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO.N dropped 2.9% after the medical equipment maker forecast annual profit below estimates.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.03-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.18-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 54 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 38 new highs and 52 new lows

"January 31, 2024 — 10:06 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-bull-market-is-here.-3-top-stocks-to-buy-like-theres-no-tomorrow,"The turning point we've all been waiting for has arrived: the new bull market. It's actually been around for the past 15 months, as the S&P 500 roared higher from its bear market low, but we can only confirm this phase of market optimism once an index has reached a new high. That happened this month, offering investors a great way to start the new year.
Now you might be wondering how long this new bull market will last and whether you still have time to benefit. And here I've got even more great news. History shows that bull markets have lasted significantly longer than bear markets -- almost 9 years versus 1.4, according to data compiled by Raymond James & Associates. This means you're not too late to this investing party, and there's plenty of time to join in on the bull market momentum. To get started, here are three top stocks to buy like there's no tomorrow.

1. Apple
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has demonstrated its strength over time, growing earnings and key metrics like free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC). The gains in ROIC in particular show the company knows how to deploy its cash wisely, and this is one reason to be optimistic about the future.
AAPL Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts.
Another reason to love this top consumer-goods player is for its moat, or competitive advantage, and that's its brand strength. Apple fans keep coming back to products like the iPhone and Apple Watch regardless of the price or the time they may have to wait for the launch of the latest version.
And on top of this, the market giant continues to grow its audience. In the most recent quarter, half of iPad and Mac buyers were new to those products. This brand strength means we should be confident about Apple's ability to deliver revenue growth over time.
Finally, this huge installed base of devices, topping two billion, opens the door for services-revenue growth as users sign up for digital content and other features. Services revenue has reached records in recent quarters and is higher margin than product revenue.
All of this shows Apple remains a monster growth stock that could lead gains in this bull market.
2. Tesla
For the first time, the best-selling vehicle in the world is an electric vehicle (EV) -- and it's a Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model Y. The EV giant delivered more than 1.2 million of the model last year, showing its own strength and the strength of EVs in general.
But let's focus on Tesla in particular right here. Yes, the company faces competition, and it has lowered prices and seen a considerable drop in operating margin -- to 8.2% in the fourth quarter from more than 16% in the year earlier period. Still, Tesla is at an important transition point, shifting its focus to lowering its costs to produce its cars and prioritizing volume and innovation. And this has helped it deliver solid results in recent times.
For instance, in the quarter, free cash flow soared 45% to more than $2 billion, and the company's cash level increased 31% to more than $29 billion. And cost of goods sold has declined to almost $36,000 per vehicle from nearly $40,000 in the same quarter a year ago.
This means the company has what it takes financially to deliver on its promises of innovation, such as advancing self-driving technology. Most recently, Tesla rolled out a beta version of a system using artificial intelligence (AI) to direct vehicle controls, such as the steering wheel or pedals.
Tesla shares declined in January, offering investors a great opportunity to get in on this top bull market -- and long-term -- buy.
3. Nvidia
AI is set to revolutionize the world, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is playing a crucial role in this potential revolution. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs), thanks to their incredible speed, power the training or the ""deep learning"" of AI tools so that they can deliver answers to complex questions and complete complicated tasks.
Today, Nvidia holds more than 80% share of this market, and though it faces competition, it's likely this chip giant will stay ahead of the game -- for a couple of reasons. First, the pattern we've seen in the central processing unit (CPU) market shows that, over time, rivals have been unable to oust Intel from the top spot. So, clearly, when dealing with processing power, an early market leader with a strong product has an advantage.
Second, Nvidia invests heavily in research and development to maintain this lead. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia's R&D spending climbed more than 18% to $2.2 billion. Thanks to solid earnings growth, Nvidia can afford to make these investments.
Finally, Nvidia doesn't depend on just one industry or one specialty. Nvidia's GPUs are still a top choice for gaming applications and graphics, and the company's AI chip uses span a broad range of industries from computing to healthcare.
Nvidia shares surged last year, but this AI leader has plenty of room to run and could lead this bull market higher.

Top Stock Reports for Apple, Visa and Novo Nordisk
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Visa Inc. and Novo Nordisk A/S. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today's research reports here >>>

Apple's shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+33.6% vs. +33.0%). The company is benefiting from strong demand for the iPhone. Apple expects the iPhone's year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024.

Revenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023's reported figure. It expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches.

For the Services segment, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.

Shares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+19.8% vs. +15.6%). The company's stock prices are driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.

Fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology, it is witnessing bottomline growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.

However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.

(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)

Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +22.8%). The company has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the diabetes market.

Obesity drug Wegovy has been enjoying increasing demand. Label expansions of diabetes and obesity care drugs in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales. Novo Nordisk raised its 2023 view due to higher demand for Ozempic and Wegovy.

Its diversifying efforts to develop new treatments are encouraging. To tackle the supply constraints of Wegovy in international markets, Novo recently announced initiating a €2.1 billion project to expand its current manufacturing facility in Chartres, France. Despite intense rivalry in the obesity care market, Novo Nordisk has been maintaining its market share.

Jan 31 (Reuters) - The tech-heavy Nasdaq was set for a lower open on Wednesday, as Alphabet and Microsoft's projections for rising AI costs dented megacap and chip stocks ahead of a crucial U.S. policy decision expected later in the day.
Alphabet GOOGL.O slumped 5.5% in premarket trading after the company reported holiday-season advertising sales below expectations and projected higher spending this year on items such as servers to power artificial intelligence.
Microsoft MSFT.O, too, slipped 0.2% after forecasting rising costs to develop new artificial-intelligence features. Its decline was limited by the company's quarterly results beat.
Even though the tech pioneers talked up how customers are lapping up their generative AI-powered products, mounting development costs for the cutting-edge features irked investors hoping for a big boost to sales from the new technology.
""Definitely costs are playing on their minds, but also a lot of this is: will AI actually translate into profits and justify the valuations that these stocks have had or will AI become a fad,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments.
The tech results and forecasts, coupled with Tesla's TSLA.O growth warning last week, have prompted renewed focus on risks from the outsized weighting of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks in the S&P 500 .SPX that have collectively pushed the benchmark index to record highs.
Apple AAPL.O, Meta Platforms META.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O, set to deliver their earnings on Thursday, fell between 0.2% and 2.4%. Together they comprise Magnificent Seven with Tesla TSLA.O, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia NVDA.O.
Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O dropped 4.7%, as the chipmaker's first-quarter revenue forecast and a boosted projection for AI processors failed to meet expectations.
Other chip stocks Nvidia, Intel INTC.O, Broadcom AVGO.O and Marvell Technology MRVL.O declined between 0.7% and 2%.
Boeing BA.N rose 1.6% incongruously after CEO Dave Calhoun delayed a financial or delivery forecast for 2024 the company, saying it has ""much to prove"" to regain regulators and customer confidence.
The focus was now on the Federal Reserve's first monetary policy decision for this year, at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady.
With an improved inflation outlook upping the possibility of policy easing sooner than later, investors will be scavenging for any hints on when the first rate cut might arrive, another key element that could determine the fate of the heavily weighted tech and tech-adjacent stocks.
The ADP National Employment report showed private payrolls rose by 107,000 in January, far less than the estimated 145,000 increment, a day after the JOLTS report reflected an unexpected rise in December job openings.

From deteriorating margins and shrinking cash flow due to a mix of price cuts and demand issues, to a not-so-confident outlook on the company's artificial intelligence (AI) projects, it wasn't Tesla's best moment.
Ultimately, many investors criticized CEO Elon Musk for the uninspiring report. And one prominent analyst on Wall Street did not hold back or mince his words.
Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities used the term ""train wreck"" to describe the conference call. He doubled down on this stance by releasing a list of 10 action items that he suggested Musk and his team could undertake in order to win back investor confidence.
With the stock already down over 20% this year, let's dig into what Ives is suggesting and assess how taking his advice could impact Tesla in the long run.
What does Dan Ives think?
After taking a couple of days to digest the earnings report, Ives took to X (formerly Twitter) to post some ideas he has for Tesla's management.
Yesterday was a dark day for Tesla (and us) but this is not the end. It's about the next chapter-how Musk/Tesla move forward at this historical moment.

"January 31, 2024 — 08:30 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-reasons-to-buy-apple-stock-like-theres-no-tomorrow,"It's not been a particularly great month for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shareholders. Worried about lagging iPhone sales, the stock was downgraded by Barclays at the very beginning of the year, and then downgraded again by Piper Sandler just a couple of days later.
The shares bounced back a bit from their early January stumble, but they're weakening again now. Indeed, it's been a lackluster past few months for shareholders with the stock sliding back to where it was priced in July of last year. Maybe the company's age and sheer size is finally catching up with it.
Or maybe not. Here's a rundown of reasons you might want to use the current lull to load up on Apple stock for the long haul.
1. Apple stock is down for all the wrong reasons
As Barclays analyst Tim Long explains of his firm's downgrade, ""We are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix, as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads, and wearables."" Piper Sandler's worry is more broad-based. Analyst Harsh Kumar notes, ""We believe that first-half 2024 will be challenging for the analog market, handset, and consumer end markets.""
In both cases, so-so demand for the iPhone 15 now portends so-so prospects for the iPhone 16 likely to debut later this year. And it's not like the worry is an unreasonable one; the analysts' points are well taken.
In both cases, however, the concerns look past a key quirky point about the iPhone. That is, demand for the device ebbs and flows not so much with the calendar or the economy, but with the device's longevity and capability. Some observers suggest many consumers may be holding out for the iPhone 16, which is widely expected to boast more memory, a better processor, and a superior camera.
In this same vein, Morgan Stanley analysts noted last year that there's incredible ""pent-up demand from consumers deferring their iPhone purchase from FY23 [ended in September]."" Morgan Stanley's number-crunching further suggests the iPhone's replacement cycle now stands at a record-breaking 4.4 years, meaning many iPhone fans simply can't wait much longer to upgrade their device.
In other words, Apple's iPhone sales could be pleasantly surprising come late 2024. And for what it's worth, even the demand for Apple's iPhone 15 may be better than some of the recent rhetoric suggests. Technology market research outfit IDC reported that after the stock's two big downgrades, fourth-quarter shipments of iPhones jumped to a two-year high of 80.5 million.
Data source: IDC. Chart by author. Figures are in millions.
Perhaps Morgan Stanley's argument for pent-up iPhone demand holds more water than it's getting credit for today.
2. It's cash-rich with modest debt
It might be growth-challenged right now, but there's no company better equipped to shrug off the impact of such a headwind.
As a reminder, Apple isn't just the world's biggest company, sporting a market capitalization of just under $3 trillion. It's also still the world's most profitable company. It turned last fiscal year's revenue of $383 billion into net income of $97 billion, more or less mirroring the prior year's results. That's huge. It's also got a little over $60 billion worth of cash or highly liquid cash-like holdings on its books.
But what about debt? It's sitting on just a little less than $100 billion in long-term debt, and another $49 billion in other long-term liabilities. That's also huge -- by other company's standards. For a business of Apple's size and caliber, however, it's enviable. This mega-company's balance sheet and reliable income stream mean it's not forced to make short-term decisions just to survive, only to create bigger problems down the road.
Said another way, access to current and future cash flow provides Apple with a strategic advantage many of its competitors simply don't have right now.
3. Apple's business model -- and mindset -- is evolving
The third reason to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow? It's a bit philosophical, but evident when you make a point of looking for it. That is, the company's business model is evolving from one merely focused on devices to a cultural, solutions-oriented one.
This idea isn't readily evident with just a superficial glance. The iPhone still accounts for a little over half of the company's revenue, after all. Dig deeper, though. Apple's doing things to expand its digital ecosystem that drives a combination of hardware and software sales.
Yes, the growth of its services arm is an example of this shift. While digital goods and services may only account for about 20% of its total top line, profit margins for this business are about three times wider than they are on sales of physical products. This is only a sampling of the paradigm shift underway, however.
Consumer-oriented cloud storage, high-performance video gaming, the continued development of its virtual reality tech called Apple Vision (despite any apparent meaningful demand for it), ongoing tinkering with artificial intelligence, and even semi-autonomous vehicles are all projects still on Apple's plate, even when they don't have to be.
This degree of speculative R&D is relatively new for Apple. Perhaps without even fully knowing how or when these efforts might pay off, the company is positioning itself to be an important technology player in an ever-changing future.
4. The most important reason is still the most important reason
The fourth and final reason to step into new stakes in Apple stock right now, however, isn't a new one at all. That is, this is still Apple. Its brand and name remain among the world's best-known -- and for good reason. It's fostered incredible loyalty to its products and services by building superior products and delivering superior service. Its tech just works.
That doesn't necessarily mean the stock's immune to an occasional bout of weakness. It's gone nowhere for the past six months, as a reminder, and was recently on the receiving end of a couple of key analyst downgrades -- analysts who were concerned about its near-term numbers.
This isn't the sort of stuff long-term investors should sweat too much, though. True long-termers should aim to own stakes in quality companies, using near-term weakness in their underlying stocks to establish those positions. And Apple at its worst is still better than many companies at their best.
In other words, now's your chance to get into a great pick at a bit of a discount.

"January 31, 2024 — 07:47 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/gen-digital-gen-to-report-q3-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-cards,"Gen Digital GEN is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1. Gen Digital was formerly known as NortonLifeLock Inc. and was trading under the NLOK ticker symbol.
NortonLifeLock changed its name and ticker symbol, effective from Nov 8, 2022, following the completed merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast Plc. The newly named company unites trusted consumer safety brands, including Norton, Avast, LifeLock, AVG, Avira, CCleaner and ReputationDefender.
The company projects quarterly revenues between $950 million and $960 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $955.8 million, indicating a 2.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $936 million.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Gen Digital expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of 49 cents-51 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 50 cents per share, indicating an 11.1% higher than the year-ago reported figure of 45 cents.
The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while matching on one occasion, the average surprise being 4.1%.
Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.
Gen Digital Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Gen Digital Inc. price-eps-surprise | Gen Digital Inc. Quote
Factors to Note
GEN’s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the increased demand for cybersecurity and ID analytics solutions in the hybrid work environment. Over the past couple of years, as more people are shifting online, the need for online privacy has been rising. Global workforces working remotely are logging into employers' networks, escalating the need for digital security. This trend is likely to have spurred the demand for Gen Digital’s security products in the fiscal third quarter.
Our third-quarter estimate for Gen Digital’s Consumer Security segment’s revenues is pegged at $611.7 million, indicating a year-over-year increase of 3.7%. Our estimate of $330 million for the Identity and Information Protection division implies growth of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.
Gen Digital’s third-quarter top line is also likely to have been primarily driven by the inclusion of the Avast business, which significantly increased the combined company’s Average Direct Customer count. Our third-quarter estimate for this key metric is pegged at 38.4 million.
Moreover, the expansion of product offerings following the merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast is likely to have facilitated the newly formed company to cross-sell products to each other’s customers, thereby aiding Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”) growth. Gen Digital’s ARPU increased by 30 cents to $7.28 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from $6.98 in the year-ago quarter.
We anticipate the trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Our third-quarter fiscal 2024 estimate for ARPU is pegged at $7.32, which is 23 cents higher than the third-quarter fiscal 2023 level.
An expansion in the EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions is also likely to have been an upside for GEN this season. Further, the growing number of client bookings, supported by their retention and renewal rates, is anticipated to have contributed to the company’s fiscal third-quarter top line. At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, Gen Digital’s client retention rate was 77%, while bookings grew 28% on a year-over-year basis.
The Norton and Avast antivirus maker’s sustained focus on growing partner channels and employee benefit programs is likely to have driven its performance in the quarter to be reported. Our estimate for the company’s Partner revenues is pegged at $98.4 million, which calls for a 3.5% increase from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, Direct Customer revenues are expected to increase 3.1% year over year to $843.4 million, per our estimate.
However, GEN’s overall third-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Additionally, increased interest expenses due to enhanced debt related to Avast acquisition financing are likely to have weighed on the bottom line. Moreover, the company’s earnings per share are expected to have been negatively impacted by the equity dilution impact of the Avast acquisition. To finance the acquisition of Avast, Gen Digital issued 94 million new shares.
What Our Model Says
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Gen Digital this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.
Though GEN currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Stocks With the Favorable Combination
Per our model, Fabrinet FN, Apple AAPL and Meta Platforms META have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.
Fabrinet carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.13%. The company is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 5. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 3.4%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fabrinet’s second-quarter earnings stands at $2.04 per share, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.4%. It is estimated to report revenues of $699.8 million, which suggests an increase of approximately 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.
Apple is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.96% at present. Apple’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being 3.5%.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.09 per share, suggesting an increase of 11.2% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.88. Apple’s quarterly revenues are estimated to improve marginally to $117.62 billion from $117.15 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Meta carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.79%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 1. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 27.5%.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.83 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 61%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $38.93 billion, calling for a year-over-year rise of 21%.

"January 31, 2024 — 07:44 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-punish-microsoft-alphabet-as-ai-returns-fall-short-of-lofty-expectations,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Samrhitha A
Jan 31 (Reuters) - Tech giants on Tuesday talked up how customers are lapping up their generative AI-powered products, but mounting costs of developing the cutting-edge features irked investors hoping for a big boost to sales from the new technology.
Shares of AlphabetGOOGL.Oclosed 7.5% lower, while those of Microsoft MSFT.O fell 2.7%, bringing down heavyweight tech stocks including Apple AAPL.O, Meta META.O and Amazon AMZN.O.
Both Microsoft and Alphabet reported generous increases to their cloud revenue in the December quarter, beating Wall Street estimates, as customers lined up to test new AI features and build their own AI services.
But costs surged as well, highlighting the heavy investments these companies are making in servers, data centers and research as they compete fiercely for new customer dollars.
This hurt investor expectations that were fueled by the promise of AI, which powered a stock rally to record highs in recent months.
""A lofty valuation means even the slightest hint of disappointment will be seized on by investors, and Microsoft's guidance for revenue growth in its cloud division to slacken a little in the current quarter was enough to see the shares dip modestly,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said he is looking for more from his firm's stakes in Alphabet and Microsoft.
""Investors want to see more contribution from AI,"" he said about Alphabet. ""Microsoft is still nascent, but showing some AI uptick.""
Alphabet's shares, which rose 58% in 2023, were trading at 22.26 times expected earnings, compared with a forward PE of 33.09 for Microsoft, 22.46 for Meta, 42.60 for Amazon and 27.73 for Apple.
""The only problem here is that Google reported earnings the same night as Microsoft ... (it is) hard to get that AI multiple pixie dust if larger cloud players are growing faster off of larger revenues,"" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.
Google and Microsoft's stock drop wiped off about $140 billion and $80 billion in their market value, respectively.
Shares of chipmaker AMDAMD.O, which boosted its 2024 forecast for AI processors to $3.5 billion on Tuesday, fell 2.5%. Analysts had previously expected AMD to sell $4 billion to $8 billion worth of AI chips, said Summit Insights analyst Kinngai Chan, adding the stock's valuation is also pegged to those figures.
Alphabet's capital expenditure in the reported quarter shot up 45% to $11 billion. Meanwhile, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said spending would be notably larger this year than 2023.
Microsoft also reported a 69% jump in capital expenditure to $11.5 billion and said it expects the metric to ""increase materially"" on a sequential basis.
""By providing a positive outlook ... (Microsoft) gave investors just enough to justify the current share price, but will need to continue to deliver on its growth trajectory in order to justify an even higher share price,"" said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson.
Luria expects Microsoft to still be able to increase margins based on keeping its overall headcount relatively flat, and investments to come back down next year once Microsoft has enough data center capacity to meet demand.

"January 31, 2024 — 07:30 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-agnc-investment-the-best-dividend-stock-for-you-1,"Income-minded investors won't find a much higher-paying option right now than AGNC Investment (NASDAQ: AGNC), with its dividend yield of almost 15%. That's a much higher yearly payout than the stock market's average annual gain.
However, stepping into this high-yielding stock simply because of its hefty dividend isn't necessarily the best move. There's more to the story. There's a lot more to the story, in fact.
But first things first.
What the heck is a mortgage REIT?
You're probably familiar with stocks of conventional companies. Owning a stake in Coca-Cola, for instance, means you share in the profits generated by the sales of some of the world's favorite beverages. A position in Apple reflects the revenue-bearing and profit-producing success of the iPhone and the company's other devices and services.
AGNC Investment isn't a conventional company, though. It's a real estate investment trust, or REIT. Most of these businersses are structured to hold rent-producing real estate like hotels, apartment complexes, or shopping malls. As long as 90% of a REIT's earnings are passed along to shareholders annually in the form of dividends, that income isn't first taxed at the corporate level (which would reduce its net bottom line).
Even by REIT standards, however, AGNC Investment is an unusual outfit. It doesn't own real estate. Rather, it owns bundles of mortgage loans made by government-run entities like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. These mortgages, of course, yield interest payments to their holders.
The twist? AGNC Investment uses borrowed money -- which also incurs interest expenses -- to purchase these bundles of mortgage loans.
That can be a bit of a head-scratcher. The REIT is paying interest to earn interest. The model usually works, however, because AGNC Investment borrows short-term funds at lower interest rates to finance purchases of longer-term mortgage loans that pay higher interest rates.
Except the model's been broken of late.
AGNC Investment on the defensive
Even if you only keep loose tabs on the market's condition, you've likely heard over the course of the past several months that the yield curve is inverted. That just means interest rates on short-term securities and bonds are higher than the interest rates on longer-term bonds and other debt -- a phenomenon sometimes seen when investors have doubts about the economy's near future, and anticipate stimulative rate cuts as a result. Such rate cuts tend to have a much greater impact on long-term bond prices, so investors gravitate toward relatively more stable short-term instruments during uncertain times.
And yes, such a shift can really mess things up for a mortgage REIT like AGNC Investment. In fact, it has messed things up for it. With its short-term borrowing costs creeping up while interest rates on its longer-term mortgage loan bundles are edging lower, AGNC Investment reported negative net interest income in each of its past four reported quarters. It's also now regularly reporting unrealized losses on the value of some of the mortgage-backed securities it's holding.
AGNC Cash from Operations (Quarterly) data by YCharts.
That hasn't prevented it from continuing to pay its dividend -- at least not yet. AGNC Investment has some cash and cash-like equivalents on its books, and it can sell securities as needed to come up with money to pay the dividend.
That's a less-than-ideal situation, though. No company wants to be forced to sell assets at terms other than of their choosing. (Price-wise, the REIT could be doing itself long-term harm by shedding securities that could be worth much more in the future.)
It's also a given that operating in the red is a problem even beyond the matter of supporting its dividend payments.
This is all why AGNC Investment has been such a disastrous performer since mid-2021, when economic cracks started to show and we first started seeing hints that the yield curve would eventually invert. The REIT's shares have lost roughly half their value over that timeframe.
There's the rub for would-be investors, of course. The dividend is still being paid, but AGNC's unrealized losses are significant. Any investor who likes the option of being able to liquidate a dividend-paying position with at least most of the initial position intact would struggle to stomach such a setback.
Then there's the other ugly reality: While the company is still paying its dividend, something has got to give sooner or later. If the yield curve remains inverted for a while, the maintaining the dividend may prove untenable.
Not the right dividend-paying stock for everyone
But maybe the global economy will experience a soft landing that un-inverts the yield curve. That would certainly work in the REIT's favor. And for the record, interest rates are moving in that direction after the fourth quarter's preliminary gross domestic product annual growth rate came in at 3.3%, which easily exceeded expectations of 2%. Never say never.
Still, this isn't palatable volatility for faint-of-heart income investors... even with the enormous dividend yield that has resulted from it. Mortgage REITs like AGNC Investment that rely heavily on borrowing leverage are highly sensitive to even the slightest degree of turbulence in interest rates and credit markets. Full-blown economic weakness can be near-catastrophic to them.
In other words, if safety is a concern, look elsewhere. You may not find another stock yielding as much as this one does. However, you can find above-average yields attached to stocks that are much less volatile and risky. Being able to sleep at night counts for something, too.

Thermo Fisher forecasts 2024 profit below estimates; shares fall
Fed expected to stay pat on rates at 2:00 p.m. ET

Jan 31 (Reuters) - Nasdaq futures slid over 1% on Wednesday, as tech giants Alphabet and Microsoft's projections for rising AI costs disappointed investors, dragging megacap and chip stocks, ahead of the U.S. policy decision expected later in the day.
Alphabet GOOGL.O slumped 5.7% in premarket trading after the company reported holiday-season advertising sales below expectations and projected higher spending this year on items such as servers to power artificial intelligence.
Microsoft MSFT.O, too, lost 0.9% after forecasting rising costs to develop new artificial-intelligence features that eclipsed a quarterly results beat.
""In the case of Alphabet, and perhaps Microsoft as well, the market is now getting the jitters that AI investments are going to keep piling up,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
""These companies have been signaling for a while that investment was needed, but it seems to have fallen on deaf ears until now.""
These results and forecasts, coupled with Tesla's TSLA.O growth warning last week, have prompted renewed focus on risks from the outsized weighting of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks in the S&P 500 .SPX that have collectively pushed the benchmark index to record highs.
Apple AAPL.O, Meta Platforms META.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O, set to deliver their earnings on Thursday, fell between 0.4% and 2.6%. Together they comprise Magnificent Seven with Tesla TSLA.O, Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia NVDA.O.
Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O tanked 6.2%, as the chipmaker's first-quarter revenue forecast and a boosted projection for AI processors by $1.5 billion failed to meet expectations.
Other chip stocks Nvidia, Intel INTC.O, Broadcom AVGO.O and Marvell Technology MRVL.O declined between 1.3% and 2.5%.
Among other major earnings, Boeing BA.N, Mastercard MA.N and Phillips 66 PSX.N are due before market open, while Qualcomm QCOM.O and Align Technology ALGN.O are expected after market close.
About 78.5% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings thus far have surpassed expectations, compared with a long-term average of 67%, according to LSEG data on Tuesday.
The focus was now on the Federal Reserve's first monetary policy decision for this year, at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady.
With an improved inflation outlook upping the possibility of policy easing sooner than later, investors will be scavenging for any hints on when the first U.S. rate cut might arrive this year, another key element that could determine the fate of the heavily weighted tech and tech-adjacent stocks.
The ADP National Employment report for January, due before market open, will also be parsed for further insights into the U.S. labor market's strength after the JOLTS report on Wednesday signaled an unexpected rise in December job openings.
At 6:57 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 51 points, or 0.13%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 24 points, or 0.48%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 203.5 points, or 1.16%.
Among others, Tesla shed 2.9% after a Delaware judge tossed out Elon Musk's record-breaking $56 billion Tesla pay package.
Mondelez International MDLZ.O lost 4.5% as price hikes squeezed demand for the Cadbury parent's chocolates and salty crackers, while Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO.N dropped 2.0% after the medical equipment maker forecast annual profit below estimates.

Jan 31 (Reuters) - Nasdaq futures slid over 1% on Wednesday, as tech giants Alphabet and Microsoft's projections for rising AI costs disappointed investors, dragging megacap and chip stocks, ahead of the U.S. policy decision expected later in the day.
Alphabet GOOGL.O slumped 5.7% in premarket trading after the company reported holiday-season advertising sales below expectations and projected higher spending this year on items such as servers to power artificial intelligence.
Microsoft MSFT.O, too, lost 0.9% after forecasting rising costs to develop new artificial-intelligence features that eclipsed a quarterly results beat.
""In the case of Alphabet, and perhaps Microsoft as well, the market is now getting the jitters that AI investments are going to keep piling up,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
""These companies have been signaling for a while that investment was needed, but it seems to have fallen on deaf ears until now.""
These results and forecasts, coupled with Tesla's TSLA.O growth warning last week, have prompted renewed focus on risks from the outsized weighting of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks in the S&P 500 .SPX that have collectively pushed the benchmark index to record highs.
Apple AAPL.O, Meta Platforms META.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O, set to deliver their earnings on Thursday, fell between 0.4% and 2.6%. Together they comprise Magnificent Seven with Tesla TSLA.O, Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia NVDA.O.
Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O tanked 6.2%, as the chipmaker's first-quarter revenue forecast and a boosted projection for AI processors by $1.5 billion failed to meet expectations.
Other chip stocks Nvidia, Intel INTC.O, Broadcom AVGO.O and Marvell Technology MRVL.O declined between 1.3% and 2.5%.
Among other major earnings, Boeing BA.N, Mastercard MA.N and Phillips 66 PSX.N are due before market open, while Qualcomm QCOM.O and Align Technology ALGN.O are expected after market close.
About 78.5% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings thus far have surpassed expectations, compared with a long-term average of 67%, according to LSEG data on Tuesday.
The focus was now on the Federal Reserve's first monetary policy decision for this year, at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady.
With an improved inflation outlook upping the possibility of policy easing sooner than later, investors will be scavenging for any hints on when the first U.S. rate cut might arrive this year, another key element that could determine the fate of the heavily weighted tech and tech-adjacent stocks.
The ADP National Employment report for January, due before market open, will also be parsed for further insights into the U.S. labor market's strength after the JOLTS report on Wednesday signaled an unexpected rise in December job openings.
At 6:57 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 51 points, or 0.13%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 24 points, or 0.48%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 203.5 points, or 1.16%.
Among others, Tesla shed 2.9% after a Delaware judge tossed out Elon Musk's record-breaking $56 billion Tesla pay package.
Mondelez International MDLZ.O lost 4.5% as price hikes squeezed demand for the Cadbury parent's chocolates and salty crackers, while Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO.N dropped 2.0% after the medical equipment maker forecast annual profit below estimates.

Jan 31 (Reuters) - Apple AAPL.O iPhone sales likely rose 3% in the key holiday period, the best growth in five quarters, but analysts expect a tough year for the company in China, where it faces regulatory headwinds and resurgent competition from Huawei.
Wall Street expects the company's latest flagship iPhone 15 to face stiff competition from Samsung's 005930.KS new Galaxy S24 packed with generative artificial intelligence features and a Huawei phone powered by a China-made chip.
Generative AI could become central to deciding who grabs the crown of the world's biggest company this year.
Microsoft MSFT.O edged ahead of Apple in the past few trading sessions with a $3 trillion valuation, and analysts expect it to cement that lead soon as it sells more AI-packed products.
While Apple shares climbed nearly 50% last year, they were still the smallest gainer among the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks.
Apple has been facing some headwinds in China, with the country's property sector grappling with problems, while officials in China have signaled that iPhones are out of favor in government offices.
IPhone shipments to China fell 2% in the December quarter, according to market research firm IDC, and analysts said Android phones are making a big comeback there, helped by Huawei's popularity.
""The iPhone faces structural challenges that will lead to a significant decline in shipments in 2024, including the emergence of a new paradigm in high-end mobile phone design and the continued decline in shipments in the Chinese market,"" Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, said in a note.
The brightest spot in Apple's first-quarter results, scheduled for Thursday, is likely to be its services segment, which includes revenue from App Store, Apple TV and Apple Music.
Services segment revenue likely grew 12.5% in Apple's quarter ended December, according to LSEG data.
However, the App Store faces headwinds in Europe, where a new law will force Apple to allow developers to skip its payment systems, and paying commission to Apple, starting in March.
Overall, Apple is expected to report quarterly revenue edged up 0.7%, ending four straight quarters of decline.
But Bernstein analysts forecast iPhone sales will fall 3% in 2024, barely boosting overall revenue.
Apple's Vision Pro, its riskiest bet since the introduction of the iPhone more than a decade ago, went up for pre-orders in the U.S. on Jan. 19. Analysts do not expect it to be a meaningful revenue driver this year.
""Greater clarity on GenAI initiatives, a successful roll-out of the Vision Pro, and updated capital allocation policies have the potential to be catalysts for Apple over the next six months,"" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said.

"January 31, 2024 — 05:51 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffett-has-%24177-billion-invested-in-these-magnificent-seven-stocks.-heres-which-1,"You won't find many of the hottest growth stocks on the market in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. His approach focuses more on stocks with attractive valuations and underlying business models that are in his circle of competence.
However, I didn't say you won't find any of these sizzling stocks among the legendary investor's holdings. Buffett has $177 billion invested in these ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.
Buffett's ""Magnificent Two""
The Magnificent Seven narrows down to the ""Magnificent Two"" as far as Buffett is concerned. It's also probably fair to say that he views one of those two stocks as much more magnificent than the other.
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) ranks as the biggest position in Berkshire's portfolio by far. The conglomerate's stake is currently worth close to $175.9 billion.
One of Berkshire's other investment managers first bought 10 million shares of Apple in May 2016. However, it didn't take long for Buffett to jump aboard the Apple train. Buying the stock turned out to be a very good move. Apple's shares have soared more than 8x since Berkshire first purchased the stock, including a gain of more than 30% over the last 12 months.
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stands as the only other Magnificent Seven stock in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. As was the case with Apple, another Berkshire investment manager initiated the position in Amazon. Buffett acknowledged shortly after the purchase of Amazon stock in 2019 that he had ""been an idiot for not buying"" sooner. Berkshire's stake in the e-commerce and cloud services giant is currently worth around $1.6 billion.
Even though Buffett was late to the party with Amazon, he's had plenty to celebrate. Over the last 12 months alone, the stock has skyrocketed nearly 60%.
Which stock could soar the most in 2024?
A greater percentage of analysts have bullish takes on Amazon than do Apple. I don't always agree with the prevailing view on Wall Street, but in this case, I think that the analysts are probably right.
Apple is a wonderful business. The stickiness of its iPhone ecosystem is truly impressive. However, investors should reasonably expect strong growth from a stock that trades at a forward earnings multiple of 29x. They're not getting it with Apple right now.
Meanwhile, Amazon continues to deliver tremendous earnings growth. The company's streamlining efforts are paying off. I predict that we'll see more evidence of this in the coming quarters as Amazon's profitability and free cash flow increase further.
Amazon also has a clear catalyst both over the near term and the long term. The rising adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, generative AI, should spur more organizations to shift their IT spending to the cloud. As the leader in the cloud services market, Amazon Web Services stands to be a key beneficiary of this trend.
The U.S. economy appears to be demonstrating more resilience than many expected as well. That bodes well for Amazon's e-commerce business in 2024.
Buffett's secret Magnificent Seven stocks
Apple and Amazon are the only Magnificent Seven stocks you'll see listed in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. However, Buffett and Berkshire do own two other members of the group.
Berkshire's subsidiary, New England Asset Management (NEAM), has a separate portfolio. Like Berkshire, NEAM has a stake in Apple. It also owns shares of Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft.
Could either of these other Magnificent Seven stocks ever find their way into Berkshire's portfolio? I think it's possible. Buffett has expressed his admiration for Google and Microsoft in the past. The biggest obstacle, for now, is probably the valuations of the two stocks. It wouldn't be a shock, though, if Buffett (or one of his lieutenants) scooped up Alphabet and/or Microsoft in the future.

"January 31, 2024 — 05:10 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-amazon-be-worth-more-than-apple-by-2030,"Five years ago, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was more valuable than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The e-commerce and cloud leader had a market cap of $821 billion, while the maker of iPhones, iPads, and Macs was worth $744 billion.
But today, Amazon is worth $1.64 trillion, while Apple has a market cap of $2.98 trillion. Let's see why Amazon fell behind Apple -- and if it might catch up and eclipse its market cap again by 2030.
Image source: Amazon.
What happened over the past five years?
Amazon generates most of its revenue from its e-commerce marketplaces, but most of its profits come from its cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Both businesses experienced accelerating and decelerating growth over the past five years.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon's e-commerce and cloud growth accelerated as more people shopped online and more companies signed up for its cloud-based services. But it faced tough year-over-year comparisons after the pandemic ended, and both businesses struggled as inflation curbed consumer spending and rising rates forced companies to rein in their spending on cloud-based services. AWS also grew at a slower rate than its closest competitor, Microsoft's Azure, as the latter ramped up its investments in its new artificial intelligence (AI) features.
That's why Amazon's revenue growth decelerated over the past three years. Jeff Bezos' departure from the CEO role in 2021 also strongly suggested its high-growth days were over.

To make matters worse, Amazon's investment in Rivian backfired as the electric vehicle (EV) maker's stock plummeted over the past two years. That investment caused Amazon to post a whopping net loss of $2.7 billion in 2022.
Amazon still grew a lot faster than Apple
If Amazon matches analysts' expectations for 2023, its revenue will have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% from 2019. By comparison, Apple grew its revenue at a CAGR of 10% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last September) as it also went through its own cycle of accelerating and decelerating growth.

Data source: Apple.
Apple's growth accelerated into fiscal 2021 as it launched its first 5G iPhones. But that upgrade cycle cooled off over the past two years -- and that slowdown was exacerbated by its persistent macro, competitive, and regulatory challenges in China.
Nevertheless, Apple's stock continued rising because its challenges seemed cyclical and its mountain of cash and marketable securities ($162 billion at the end of fiscal 2023) made it a safe-haven investment amid inflation and rising rates. Amazon held $64 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in the third quarter of 2023.
Apple also bought back 16% of its shares over the past five years, while Amazon's share count rose 5% during the same period. Apple only pays a tiny forward dividend yield of 0.5%, but Amazon doesn't pay anything at all. Those shareholder-friendly strategies likely made Apple a more compelling play for long-term investors than Amazon.
What could happen in the next six years?
Amazon's stock isn't cheap right now, at 44 times forward earnings. But looking ahead, analysts expect its revenue to rise at a CAGR of 11% from 2023 to 2025 as the macroeconomic environment improves. They also expect its EPS to grow at a CAGR of 33%.
Apple's stock seems cheaper at 29 times forward earnings. However, analysts only expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 5% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, and for its EPS to rise at a CAGR of 9%. We should take all of those estimates with a grain of salt, but Apple could certainly struggle if it doesn't diversify its top line away from the aging iPhone.
Amazon could continue to grow faster than Apple through the end of the decade, but its valuations are a bit stretched. If Amazon maintains its current valuations, matches analysts' expectations, and grows its EPS at a CAGR of 20% from 2025 to 2030, its market cap would reach $5.5 trillion by the final year. If Apple does the same thing and grows its EPS at a CAGR of 10% from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2030, it would be worth $5.2 trillion.
Therefore, Amazon has a narrow path toward overtaking Apple again by 2030, but only if it stabilizes its e-commerce and cloud businesses. If either of those growth engines sputter out, its price-to-earnings ratio could plummet and prevent it from ever matching Apple's market cap. Apple's lower multiple, reputation as a safe-haven play, and constant buybacks arguably give it a much clearer path toward reaching a $5 trillion valuation.
A lot could happen over the next six years, but I suspect Amazon will still be worth less than Apple by 2030. Both stocks are still solid long-term investments, but Amazon simply faces more unpredictable challenges than Apple -- which can continue to leverage its scale, luxury appeal, and expanding ecosystem to lock in more consumers.

TAIPEI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Taiwan's trade-dependent economy accelerated in the fourth quarter, growing faster than expected thanks to strong domestic consumption and a rebound in exports, and expanded 1.4% for the full year.
Taiwan is a key hub in the global technology supply chain for companies such as Apple Inc AAPL.O, and home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW, TSM.N.
Gross domestic product grew by a preliminary 5.12% in the October-December period from a year earlier, the statistics agency said on Wednesday, beating the 4.35% growth forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.
Quarter-on-quarter, the economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 8.79%.
GDP grew 2.32% year-on-year in the third quarter.
Taiwan's exports, a main driver of the island's economy, emerged from a year-long decline in September.
Fourth-quarter exports rose 3.4% year-on-year after contracting at a 5.1% annual rate in the third quarter, while the island's trade surplus leapt 131% year-on-year in the final three months of the year.
Full year growth of 1.4% slightly missed the statistics bureau's November forecast of 1.42%, its slowest pace in 14 years and lower than the 2.45% growth for 2022.
The economy in China, Taiwan's largest export market, grew 5.2% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, picking up from 4.9% in the third quarter, but missing a 5.3% forecast in a Reuters poll.
Taiwan's statistics agency will provide revised figures a few weeks later, with more details and forward-looking forecasts.

NEW DELHI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - India has cut the import duty on some parts used in making mobile phones to 10% from 15%, a move benefiting companies like Apple AAPL.O and Xiaomi 1810.HK that manufacture in Asia's third-largest economy.
The import duty on parts such as battery covers, main camera lenses, back covers, other mechanical items of plastic and metal, GSM antenna, and other parts, has been reduced to 10%, the finance ministry said in a notification late on Tuesday.
The import duty on inputs used to manufacture these components has been cut to zero, the notification said.
Earlier this month, Reuters reported that India was considering import duty cuts on key components for producing high-end mobile phones.
The move will make India’s mobile phone manufacturing more competitive, the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) said in a statement.
With global mobile companies manufacturing in India, mobile phone exports from the country doubled year-on-year to $11.1 billion in the fiscal year to March 2023 and are expected to rise to $15 billion in the current fiscal year, according to industry estimates.

Jan 30 (Reuters) - AI-related companies lost $190 billion in stock market value late on Tuesday after Microsoft MSFT.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O delivered quarterly results that failed to impress investors who had sent their stocks soaring.
The selloff following the tech giants' reports after the bell underscored investors' elevated expectations following an AI-fueled stock market rally in recent months that propelled their shares to record highs with the promise of incorporating the technology across the corporate landscape.
Alphabet dropped 5.6% after the Google-parent's December-quarter ad revenue missed expectations.
Alphabet also said its spending on data centers to support its AI plans would jump this year, highlighting the costs of its fierce competition against AI rival Microsoft.
While Google Cloud revenue growth slightly topped Wall Street targets, boosted by interest in AI, Microsoft's Azure grew faster.
Microsoft beat analyst estimates for quarterly revenue as new AI features helped attract customers to its cloud and Windows services. However, its stock fell 0.7% in extended trade after briefly hitting an intra-day record high earlier on Tuesday.
Optimism about AI pushed Microsoft's stock market value above $3 trillion this month, eclipsing Apple AAPL.O.
Chipmaker Advanced Micro tumbled 6% after its forecast for first-quarter revenue missed estimates, even as it projected strong sales for its AI processors.
Shares of Nvidia NVDA.O, which have surged 27% in January after more than tripling last year on AI optimism, also gave back some of those gain in extended trade, last down over 2%.
Server maker Super Micro Computer, another company that has benefited from AI-related demand, dropped over 3%. Earlier on Tuesday, it had climbed to a record high after delivering blowout quarterly results the day before.

"January 30, 2024 — 05:00 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/brians-big-idea-on-big-caps,"On the simplest level investors classify stocks as either large cap mid cap or small cap. The cap is what we call market capitalization or the total value of the company. The big cap stocks tend to be front and center of the news flow and mindshare of most investors.
Brian Bolan takes a look at 3 big cap stocks, two of which are reporting tonight after the close.
Microsoft MSFT is one of those names and Brian highlights the good growth the company has posted and is expected to see in 2024.
Other key ideas covered in the video were how some investors think about the idea of an earnings history and if management is guiding Wall Street to the appropriate level.
Next up is Apple AAPL which reports on the first of February after the close of the market. The growth for Apple is well below that of Microsoft MSFT but it is also in the $3T market cap range.
Brian also looks at Advanced Micro Devices AMD who is also reporting after the close tonight.
AMD is expected to post a contraction in terms of revenue growth for 2023, but an acceleration to more than 15% in 2024. Brian laments that investors don’t buy stocks for what they have done, rather what they will do in the future.
Finally Brian reviews the pay for service at Zacks call Large Cap Trader. The service is headed up by John Blank. The service has a lot of green on the screen and gives investors not only stock selections but also weighting in the portfolio. That allows subscribers to the service to easily allocate their portfolio to align with the service’s holdings.
Brian notes that the highest weighted position is also up nearly 20% in just a few months. Large Cap Trader also has about a 40% cash position so there is a lot of dry powder looking for a good investment.

(V) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>

Apple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+33.6% vs. +33.0%). The company is benefiting from strong demand for the iPhone. Apple expects the iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024.

Revenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023’s reported figure. It expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches.

For the Services segment, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.

Shares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+19.8% vs. +15.6%). The company’s stock prices are driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.

Fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology, it is witnessing bottomline growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.

However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.

Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +22.8%). The company has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the diabetes market.

Obesity drug Wegovy has been enjoying increasing demand. Label expansions of diabetes and obesity care drugs in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales. Novo Nordisk raised its 2023 view due to higher demand for Ozempic and Wegovy.

Its diversifying efforts to develop new treatments are encouraging. To tackle the supply constraints of Wegovy in international markets, Novo recently announced initiating a €2.1 billion project to expand its current manufacturing facility in Chartres, France. Despite intense rivalry in the obesity care market, Novo Nordisk has been maintaining its market share.

"January 30, 2024 — 04:23 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-must-watch-stocks-just-as-unstoppable-as-nvidia,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains one of the hottest stocks in the market right now, with shares eeking out yet another 2.35% gain on Monday’s session. After Nvidia stock’s January jump, shares are flirting with 30% in year-to-date gains. That’s an impressive annual return, let alone one posted in under a month. As to when (or if) shares of the chip giant are bound to reverse course remains the top question on the minds of shareholders and those enjoying the Nvidia show from the sidelines.
Some way or another, NVDA stock has found a way to keep pulling rabbits out of hats, something that could easily continue through 2024. Either way, Nvidia stock remains a dangerous stock to bet against amid its AI tailwind.
Though momentum investors still have lots to love about Nvidia and its latest melt-up, I’d argue it’s worth checking in on other stocks that have already gained traction in recent weeks. Indeed, many such plays may be overheated after their respective rallies. However, each is worth keeping tabs on as we march into earnings season. Let’s check in briefly with three momentum stocks as strong as Nvidia that I’d stash in the “must-watch” category.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Warren Buffett’s low-tech conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B, BRK-A) has been steadily (and pretty quietly) making new highs in recent sessions. Just last week, the stock hit $385 and change after enjoying a remarkable seven-day win streak. Thanks, in part, to its huge investment in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Japanese companies and various other firms, Berkshire Hathaway is now a stock that has something for value and momentum investors to love.
Though Berkshire hasn’t been ultra active of late, it has made intriguing moves, including buying more shares of Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA). With shares of LSXMA currently trading at just 11.6 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), it’s not hard to imagine why Buffett’s firm has picked up a few more shares. Indeed, the stock looks cheap in a market that may be getting a tad overheated.
As Berkshire continues playing the long-term game, it remains one of the more value-conscious picks to make the new all-time high list. And it’s worth tuning into if you’re off-put by some of the tech scene right now.
T-Mobile US (TMUS)
Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com
T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) stock also recently hit new heights after clocking in a handful of respectable quarters last year. More recently, the firm missed earnings estimates for its fourth quarter but topped on sales. Despite the initial adverse reaction, investors now seem more forgiving, given the company’s high hopes for new customer additions in 2024.
Undoubtedly, the red-hot wireless play has been flying above and beyond its peers in the telecom industry. Led higher by an impressive network (it’s one to beat) and competitive prices, T-Mobile stands out as one of the market gainers that doesn’t seem content just sitting around.
T-Mobile stock’s impressive performance (shares up 134% in the last five years) versus the peer group suggests the wireless scene is transforming into a winner-takes-most sort of environment. And as our high-speed data consumption grows, it’s hard not to want to jump on the T-Mobile bandwagon as it looks to enter the industry’s newest chapter of growth.
At writing, shares trade at 23.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). That’s not a hefty multiple to pay for an industry leader with a distinct edge and a management team that knows how to get things done.
For 2024, analysts expect TMUS stock to continue doing what it does best: make higher highs.
Costco (COST)
Source: Shutterstock
Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is another low-tech stock having a breakout moment, of sorts. With shares flirting with $700 per share — one more big up day will do it — COST may very well be the next momentum stock to hog the headlines should Nvidia stock’s rally begin to falter. Either way, Costco’s management seems well-equipped to make the most of the traffic surge in its stores.
Many Costco shoppers have a bulk appetite for the Kirkland Signature brand (Costco’s high-quality private label) these days, and it is not a mystery as to why. Costco does private labels far better than any other large-scale retailer, in my opinion. With Kirkland, Costco shows us that consumers don’t need to compromise on quality to save money amid hard times.
As Costco expands Kirkland (perhaps they should sell Kirkland Signature gold bars next?), Costco stands out as a momentum stock that can (and likely will) grow into its seemingly expensive trailing P/E — currently 46.73.

Jan 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O beat Wall Street estimates for fiscal second-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as new AI features helped attract customers to its cloud and Windows services.
Microsoft shares fell 1% in volatile after-hours trading, and then rose slightly. They climbed 57% last year. Along with a rally in other tech stocks, including Alphabet GOOGL.O and Nvidia NVDA.O, Microsoft helped fuel a 24% surge in the S&P 500 .SPX in 2023.
""We've moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,"" CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. ""By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we're winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.""
Revenue grew 18% to $62 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with the average analyst estimate of $61.12 billion, according to LSEG data.
Revenue at Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which houses the Azure cloud computing platform, grew 20% to $25.9 billion. Sales of Azure, for which Microsoft does not disclose a dollar figure, grew 30%, compared with a 27.7% consensus estimate from Visible Alpha.
Investors are watching Microsoft's Azure and Office revenues closely to see what kind of sales flow come from the tens of billions of dollars the company plans to pour into data centers this year to deliver generative AI.
Microsoft's stock surge has helped it topple AppleAAPL.O as the world's most valuable listed company in the past few trading sessions. Investors have rewarded the company's push into AI and strategic partnership with Silicon Valley startup and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.
Microsoft's share surge was not dented by a power struggle within OpenAI that highlighted the software giant's lack of direct control over its important partner. Microsoft also faces some legal and regulatory challenges.
In November, Microsoft started selling Copilot, an AI assistant that can summarize an email inbox or craft a slide show, for $30 per month, which analysts say is a premium price.
Early sales of the product showed up in the firm's commercial sales of Office software, where revenue grew 17%, compared with analyst expectations of commercial Office sales growth of 14.2%, according to data from Visible Alpha. Microsoft does not provide an absolute dollar figure for the sales.
For its fiscal second quarter, Microsoft reported an adjusted profit of $2.93 per share, compared with analyst estimates of $2.78 per share.

"January 30, 2024 — 03:53 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/californias-landmark-climate-disclosure-laws-challenged-by-business-groups,"By Clark Mindock
Jan 30 (Reuters) - Major U.S. business groups sued California on Tuesday seeking to overturn the state's new sweeping climate disclosure laws that require companies to publicly report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risks.
The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles federal court by the biggest U.S. business lobby, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, along with the American Farm Bureau Federation and several California business groups. They claim the first-of-their-kind laws will impose ""massive"" costs on businesses and violate free speech protections in the U.S. Constitution by compelling the disclosures.
The groups also claim the laws are invalid because they act as de facto national emissions regulations. Federal regulators are exclusively empowered to regulate emissions under the U.S. Clean Air Act, and are best situated to develop regulations that apply consistently across the country, the groups said in the lawsuit.
""California’s laws usurp the role of federal regulators, opening the door for other states to take an opposite approach to disclosure, leaving businesses and their investors caught in the middle of a political scrap between states,"" said Tom Quaadman, an executive director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in a statement.
The California Air Resources Board, which was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, declined to comment.
Signed into law last year by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, the two laws aim to help the public and investors evaluate climate-related claims by major companies.
One of the challenged laws requires public and private companies that are active in the state and generate revenue of more than $1 billion annually to publish an extensive account of their carbon emissions starting in 2026. The law requires the disclosure of both the companies' own emissions and indirect emissions by their suppliers and customers, also known as Scope 3 emissions.
The other challenged law requires companies that operate in the state with over $500 million in revenue to disclose climate-related financial risks and strategies to mitigate that risk.
The laws, which were endorsed by some major companies, like Apple AAPL.O, Ikea and Microsoft MSFT.O, are being challenged as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is working to finalize its own climate disclosure rules.
A draft of the federal rules released in 2022 would require public companies to disclose their own emissions as well as Scope 3 emissions, but SEC officials have privately indicated the agency is considering backing away from requiring disclosure of those indirect emissions due to concerns that including them will make rules vulnerable to legal challenges.
For many businesses, Scope 3 emissions account for 70% of their carbon footprint, according to the consulting firm Deloitte.

"January 30, 2024 — 03:09 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/payments-firm-paypal-to-reduce-global-workforce-by-9-in-2024,"By Hannah Lang and Manya Saini
Jan 30 (Reuters) - Payments firm PayPal Holdings PYPL.O is planning to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its global workforce, this year, a letter from CEO Alex Chriss, seen by Reuters, showed on Tuesday.
In the letter to staff, newly appointed CEO Chriss said the decision was made to ""right-size"" the company through both direct cuts and the elimination of open roles throughout the year. The staff that will be affected are expected to be notified by the end of the week.
""We are doing this to right-size our business, allowing us to move with the speed needed to deliver for our customers and drive profitable growth,"" Chriss wrote in the letter.
The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Paypal's shares were last up 0.5% in late afternoon trading.
In November, Chriss said he expects to increase revenue outside of purely transaction-related volume and pledged to turn the fintech firm leaner by reducing its cost base.
Though the announcement had helped rally the stock after third-quarter results, analysts have remained focused on PayPal's margins in recent quarters.
The company's low-margin business products have risen strongly, while growth in its branded products has slowed due to increased pressure from competitors such as Apple AAPL.O.
Investors hope Chriss, who was previously a senior executive at software company Intuit INTU.O, will revive PayPal's stock. It fell nearly 14% last year and missed a broader sector-wide rebound in high-growth technology shares.
Last week, the payments firm announced it was launching new artificial intelligence-driven products as well as a one-click checkout feature.
Meanwhile, rival Block SQ.N, led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, also began to cut jobs this week as part of its previously disclosed plans to trim headcount and reduce costs, a source told Reuters.

AI stocks are surging ahead with unprecedented success, building upon their stellar performance last year. Artificial intelligence firms focusing on semiconductor giants have effectively reshaped market dynamics. Moreover, China’s strategic support for more than 40 AI models has significantly bolstered this surge, marking a pivotal moment in the global adoption of AI.
However, the anticipation surrounding AI stocks, often celebrated as market juggernauts, meets a crossroads of varied expectations as 2024 progresses. While some market watchers remain optimistic, others foresee an unmatched growth opportunity on the horizon. This divergence in market sentiment paints a complex yet fascinating landscape for AI investments.
Financially, Next Move Strategy Consulting predicts the AI market’s leap from $100 billion to a whopping $2 trillion by 2030. Amidst this, three AI stocks emerge as hidden treasures. These offer a unique blend of innovation and strategic opportunity for the savvy investor in this transformative era.
Axcelis Technologies (ACLS)

Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) is the architect behind AI chip optimization, wielding innovation as its key weapon. Witness their groundbreaking Purion H200 single-wafer high-current implanter, unleashed in 2022, revolutionizing premier AI chip manufacturing. This technological marvel propels their sales and earnings skyward, solidifying their worldwide leadership in ion implantation systems.
Moreover, in its financial report, Axcelis announced a robust third quarter, with GAAP earnings per share hitting $1.99, surpassing forecasts by 26 cents. The company’s revenue reached an impressive $292.3 million, a 27.5% bump year-over-year, outdoing expectations by $12.06 million. This financial strength underscores Axcelis’s pivotal role in enhancing AI chip performance through its critical services.
Furthermore, Axcelis’s unwavering commitment to maximizing shareholder returns is evident as it infuses an extra $200 million into its share repurchase program, signaling a confident outlook. With a ‘buy’ rating from Wall Street analysts and an anticipated 25.4% upside, Axcelis is marching ahead, setting industry benchmarks.
Baidu Inc (BIDU)

Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), a Chinese tech company known for internet services and AI technology, is strategically positioning itself at the forefront of AI innovation. Baidu’s proactive steps to monetize its AI services, coupled with a ‘strong buy’ rating and a projected 53% upside potential by Wall Street analysts, underscore its robust position in AI technology.
Financially, Baidu’s recent earnings report showcases its robust performance. Non-GAAP earnings per American depositary share of $2.80, comfortably beating the $2.34 estimate, alongside a revenue increase of 3.3% year over year to $4.72 billion. This fiscal health, combined with BofA’s reiterated confidence in Baidu’s AI prospects, underscores the company’s strong market position.
Furthermore, Baidu is making waves in the tech world with its strategic partnership with Samsung Electronics. This dynamic collaboration is poised to transform the smartphone experience, thanks to the seamless integration of Baidu’s advanced Ernie AI into Samsung’s latest Galaxy S24 series in China, marking a significant leap in AI-driven mobile technology.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stands as a formidable force in the AI stock landscape, benefiting from the escalating demand for AI chips in data centers and edge computing. With many integrated device manufacturers transitioning to fabless designers over the years, TSM has solidified its pivotal role in chip production.
In a resounding display of prowess, TSM actively leads the way by excelling in the manufacturing of 3-nanometer chips for industry giants such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).

There are some popular stocks for 2024 that investors should pay attention to. These companies represent some of the most capitalized companies on the major exchanges, which underlines their popularity. These companies are further bolstered as fan favorites due to their strong, instantly recognizable brands and loyal customer bases.
I expect that these popular stocks for 2024 will continue to be in prominence for many years to come. So here are seven of these companies to consider.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Moab Republic / Shutterstock
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is consistently a favorite among investors due to its strong brand and innovative products.
I expect that this year will be a strong one for AAPL, thanks in part to the release of the Apple Vision Pro, a mixed-reality headset. It combines elements of virtual and augmented reality to allow users to tap into digital worlds and could be a way to dive head-first into the metaverse. The headset is equipped with twin 4K displays, offering HDR picture quality with high pixel density. The visuals are designed to be clear and realistic.
Furthermore, AAPL is partnering with companies like Disney (NYSE:DIS) to offer its users exclusive content, which may give consumers an independent reason to take a look at it. Pre-orders have already started for the headset, and the release date is scheduled for February. This then makes it one of those popular stocks for 2024.
Tesla (TSLA)
Source: ssi77 / Shutterstock.com
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a popular choice for investors interested in technology and sustainability thanks to its innovations in electric vehicles and batteries.
It should be noted, though, that TSLA stock has suffered recently. Notably, revenue growth has slowed, and its cash generation has decreased, primarily due to increased competition in the electric vehicle market.
But there are two sides to every story. On the other hand, TSLA’s EPS is expected to surge in the low double-digits throughout FY2025 and FY2026. That’s 31.39% and 32.26%, specifically, and that also comes with higher revenue projections for those years.
Although TSLA is feeling the heat from some of the newer entrants to the market, specifically from Chinese automakers like Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), which offer competitive Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), I believe that TSLA’s all-American appeal will continue to be a strong one, which may give some buffer to its competitive moat.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
As a leader in e-commerce and, more recently, cloud computing, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a mainstay in many investment portfolios.
The company is popular enough to have redefined how millions of Americans shop for essential goods. Having Amazon AWS certifications for developers and network engineers is also becoming increasingly important, so Amazon is redefining huge aspects of society.
While AWS has been growing more slowly compared to Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, it is expected to pick up steam. This is due to the progressive implementation of generative AI, which could be another realm in which it will compete.
AMZN’s EPS is expected to surge this year, by 34.80%. There’s an 11% projection for its top line to increase as well, which makes it one of those popular stocks for 2024 for investors to keep on top of.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft has many forks in the fire that make it among those popular stocks for 2024. These growth drivers include software, cloud services, and, increasingly, hardware.
It’s also branching out into fields such as quantum computing, and, of course, its partnership with OpenAI has breathed some new life into its Bing search engine.
These initiatives have all done their part to make investors feel they are doing the right thing by holding MSFT stock, but there’s more. Microsoft has been performing very well, with revenue in its most recent quarter rising by 13% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) soaring by 27%.
Looking ahead, things look accretive for the company as these growth drivers continue to unfold. 
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has a wide range of interests in technology, from search engines to self-driving cars. Google is one of the most recognizable brands on the planet and is one of the few companies ever to have its business name coined as a verb: “Google it,”
Alphabet also owns two of the most-visited websites on the Internet (Google and YouTube) and has one of the most popular smartphone operating systems (Android) and one of the largest ad networks. As one of the key members of the Majestic 7, the GOOG stock price surged over 57.01%. This came amid the AI-induced craze and the company releasing its chatbot, Claude.
Looking ahead, and things only look positive from here for the company. Analysts predict that there will be low double-digit growth for its EPS from 2024 to 2028, growing to $13.14 per share as the median estimate. As Alphabet continues to maintain its relevance, there could be appreciable stock price increases on the horizon as well, moving in step with a growing top line and swelling profitability.
Meta Platforms (META)

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a major player in social media and is investing heavily in the development of virtual and augmented reality. META opened the floodgates to Web 2.0, and I expect that it will continue to remain strong and relevant throughout this year and beyond.
This brand recently reached a $1 trillion market capitalization, which underscores that investors are increasingly willing to bet on the metaverse and Mark Zuckerberg’s vision for the future.
As I’ve discussed in previous articles, I believe that the metaverse is more than just virtual headsets and living in independent realities, but rather a continued shift of blurring the physical reality with our digital lives, which has been ongoing since even before the release of social media. META’s top line is expected to swell from $154.36 billion in FY2024 to $225.44 billion in FY2028. This then makes it one of those popular stocks for 2024, and beyond that, investors should follow closely.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is at the forefront of graphics processing technology and is making significant strides in artificial intelligence and gaming.
Before the advent of cryptocurrencies, NVDA still made some of the best GPUs around and shared a close rivalry with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Today NVDA stock has pulled far ahead of its rival, and has many forks in the fire for future growth.
NVDA stock is one of the new brands in the Majestic Seven that still carry a “Strong buy” rating along with a projected increase in its stock price. This, combined with its strong position in the consumer electronics market and cryptocurrency mining space, makes a strong contender to watch for capital appreciation

"January 30, 2024 — 12:08 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-apple-aapl-a-buy-heading-into-fiscal-q1-earnings-announcement,"Tech heavyweight Apple AAPL is set to report quarterly results on Thursday after the bell. Apple, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), boasts a stellar track record of exceeding earnings estimates. As AAPL stock hovers near all-time highs, is the iPhone maker a buy heading into earnings?
Analysts are expecting AAPL to deliver quarterly earnings of $2.09 per share, which would reflect growth of 11.17% relative to the same quarter in the prior year. Revenues of $117.6 billion would mark a 0.4% improvement versus the year-ago period. Apple has beaten earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters, sporting a 3.47% average earnings surprise over that timeframe.
Apple’s business contains a Services portfolio that has steadily grown over time, including popular services like Apple Pay and AppleCare that have become a major cash cow. The company also recently launched the mixed reality Vision Pro headset.

"January 30, 2024 — 09:19 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/factors-to-note-ahead-of-dolbys-dlb-q1-earnings-release-0,"Dolby Laboratories Inc DLB is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $310.9 million, indicating a decrease of 7.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at 89 cents, indicating a year-over-year decrease of 19.8%.
The company expects GAAP EPS of 44-59 cents and non-GAAP EPS of 80-95 cents on revenues of $300-$330 million for the fiscal first quarter.
Dolby Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise
Dolby Laboratories price-eps-surprise | Dolby Laboratories Quote
Factors to Note
The company’s quarterly performance is likely to have been affected by lower shipments in broadcast and consumer electronics due to macroeconomic weakness. Rising research and development costs to fend off stiff competition continue to strain DLB’s margins.
Our estimate for broadcast and consumer electronics sales is pegged at $108.1 million and $41 million, indicating a decline of 7.9% and 25.6%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure.
However, the company’s performance is likely to have benefited from the increasing adoption of Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and new imaging patents. The company expects revenues from these businesses to grow by a high single digit in fiscal 2024.
Also, the company’s initiatives to boost growth in newer areas like music, automotive and user-generated content with the help of Dolby Vision Capture bodes well. In the last quarter, the company signed an agreement with a Chinese car manufacturer — BYD — to launch a car with Dolby Atmos.
Apart from this, the increasing adoption of Dolby Atmos Music to broadcast high-quality content to Dolby-enabled devices is a major tailwind.  The company is likely to have benefited from the adoption of Dolby.io, which is a platform that enables developers to build immersive online experiences. The growing demand for high-quality with ultra-low latency applications is further tailwinds.
What Our Model Says
Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Dolby this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.
DLB has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

"January 30, 2024 — 09:06 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buffett-bots-best-bets%3A-3-top-stock-picks-from-a-warren-trained-ai-model,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Warren Buffett is often hailed as one of the greatest investors, with a track record that has consistently outpaced the broader markets. Could artificial intelligence (AI) emulate his success? I recently discovered an intriguing AI model called the “Buffett Bot” that was trained to mimic Warren Buffett.
As AI continues making strides across industries, it’s no surprise some clever developers have aimed these analytical engines at the financial markets. And basing one on the Oracle of Omaha himself seems like an especially smart play. Of course, this AI isn’t the real Buffett, but it offers a fascinating glimpse into how modern data science attempts to replicate legendary investors.
I’ll be taking a look at the stock picks recently put forward by this Buffett-inspired AI. The model imitates Buffett’s penchant for finding strong yet reasonably-valued businesses. It will be intriguing to see what kind of companies and sectors the Buffett Bot highlights as solid investments. While this AI is unlikely to fully capture the depth of real-world experience and nuanced judgment behind Buffett’s brilliance, it may still surface some appealing prospects. At the very least, its selections should provide thoughtful food for thought.
Moody’s (MCO)
Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com
Moody’s (NYSE:MCO) holds an enormously influential position in global finance as one of the “Big Three” credit ratings agencies alongside S&P (NYSE:SPGI) and Fitch. This oligopoly enjoys durable competitive advantages from high barriers to entry and a sticky customer base. Thus, I’m not surprised to see Buffett Bot tap Moody’s as a smart Buffett-style bet.
After all, the real Buffett also knows a thing or two about this industry leader – MCO occupies a sizable 2.6% allocation in Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio. For a man with a highly concentrated portfolio anchored by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), carving out such a large niche for Moody’s signals conviction in its prospects.
And why shouldn’t Buffett have this conviction? Moody’s just delivered another quarter of impressive growth in Q3 2023. Revenue grew 15% year-over-year, powered by strong performance across ratings and research, data and analytics, and M&A. Meanwhile, the company’s EBITDA leapt 32%.
No doubt, Moody’s trades at a steep premium. Its shares currently command a valuation of roughly 12-times forward sales and 39-times forward earnings. However, the company’s growth prospects support these rich valuations. Analysts forecast annual earnings per share growth of around 15% over the next five years on the back of near double-digit revenue expansion. In an entrenched triopoly that’s strategically expanding its presence across high-margin adjacencies, I believe Moody’s warrants its above-average multiple.
As an added bonus: Moody’s pays out a small but growing dividend that yields 0.8%. Moody’s offers compelling total return potential as a Buffett-approved blue-chip with fortress positioning in an essential global industry. I agree with the Oracle and his digital doppelgänger that this is a long-term winner.
Brookfield Asset Management (BAM)

While not currently a Berkshire holding, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) aligns nicely with the Buffett school of thought. This alternative asset manager focuses on real assets like infrastructure, real estate, renewables, and private equity – tangible categories that benefit society. Its value-based approach centers on acquiring high-quality assets during times of distress or dislocation to generate strong risk-adjusted returns.
In other words, Brookfield brings a long-term lens to its investing framework, and is backed by a strong balance sheet – key “Buffettesque” principles. So, I understand why a digital version of the Oracle tapped Brookfield as an intriguing pick. As attention pivots toward renewable energy and infrastructure spending while real estate rebounds from pandemic lows, this is a company with plenty of tailwinds to consider.
The company’s growth forecasts look promising, too. Brookfield anticipates 17% annualized sales growth over the next two years alongside 19% earnings growth in 2025. While its forward price-earnings ratio of 26-times based on estimated 2024 earnings seems somewhat rich, I believe this premium makes sense for a company eyeing high-teens bottom-line boosts. Plus, shareholders get paid to wait via a 3.2% dividend yield that should keep growing.
I agree with Buffett Bot that BAM stock warrants a spot in a long-term-focused portfolio.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
It’s no secret that Buffett largely missed the boat on new tech like AI over the years. But the small Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) position (recently trimmed) in Berkshire’s portfolio proves that even old dogs can learn some new tricks. And while Buffett may not be ready to fully embrace fast-moving tech disruptors, his digital descendant shows more enthusiasm in tapping Amazon’s immense potential.
Now, AMZN stock trades at a nosebleed valuation. Shares of the e-commerce giant currently trade for more than 82-times trailing earnings. But when you dominate the secular growth engines of e-commerce and cloud like Amazon does, lofty multiples feel warranted. Remember, AWS alone commands a 41.5% market share in the cloud, greater than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and IBM (NYSE:IBM) combined!
Meanwhile, early pandemic aftershocks to the e-commerce sector have settled, paving the way for growth re-acceleration. Over the last three years, Amazon’s net sales grew outpaced over 84% of marketwide peers. And though its price-earnings ratio seems extremely rich for a company of this scale, it falls below Amazon’s 5-year average near 120-times.

"January 30, 2024 — 09:03 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-mental-trick-you-can-use-if-you-want-to-invest-in-the-sp-500-but-dont-like-the,"The Magnificent Seven stocks have gotten a lot of buzz as of late. And for good reason.
The term was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett and is used to describe seven massive tech-focused companies -- Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). All seven companies are industry leaders and influential in their own right. But 2023 changed just how important this group is.
Last year, the Magnificent Seven gained between 48.2% on the low end (Apple) and a blistering 238.9% on the high end (Nvidia). Even more astonishing is the sheer value creation.
Entering 2023, the total value of the Magnificent Seven was $6.92 trillion. Entering 2024, the value ballooned to... wait for it... $12.04 trillion! Over $5 trillion in value was created in a single calendar year.
Fast forward to today, and the Magnificent Seven make up 28.4% of the S&P 500. For context, the entire tech sector makes up 29.2% of the S&P 500 (Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are not in the tech sector). If you're buying an S&P 500 index fund -- as so many people do -- a significant part of your investment is really in the Magnificent Seven.
Some investors may be feeling like these companies are overvalued -- or at the very least, they're looking for other opportunities. Yet the reality is that the American economy is heavily dependent on these companies. And they are a key reason why the U.S. economy has done so well, relative to international markets.
Here's a simple mental trick to help cope with investing in the Magnificent Seven.

The new normal
One of the biggest mistakes investors make is underestimating the mental side of investing. When equity prices are falling, the fight-or-flight response kicks in.
People want to take action by trading their way out of the sell-off (fighting) or selling everything and walking away (flying). But both those responses have proven detrimental in every bear market. The best course of action is to suppress instinct and do nothing.
In a bull market, following the herd and buying stocks to ride the wave can be tempting. But again, it's better to have a balanced approach of focusing on companies you understand and believe in long term, and not buying a hot stock just because you think it will go up.
I've been following the stock market for a long time. And the reason behind writing this article is because the S&P 500 feels, frankly, uncomfortable. Maybe more than ever before.
Having just a handful of companies make up so much of the market's value changes the composition of the S&P 500. It's even more lopsided in the Nasdaq 100, where just shy of 40% of the value is in the Magnificent Seven. The market feels more abstract than ever before because so much of the value is in companies that don't make products that people see or have businesses solely tied to the digital world. There has never been a time in the S&P 500 where so much of the market cap was concentrated in tech-related companies.
Just a decade ago, the top 10 most valuable companies by market cap were, in order, Apple, ExxonMobil, Alphabet, Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart, Chevron, Wells Fargo, and Procter & Gamble. Five years ago, no single company was worth over $1 trillion. Today, five of the Magnificent Seven stocks have market capitalizations above $1 trillion, while Meta Platforms is within striking distance and Tesla has had a market cap of over $1 trillion before.
The portfolio tax
Picking individual stocks or making contrarian investment decisions can be fun and freeing. But it's a step too far to completely disagree with the market's trajectory or not want to invest in the stock market just because you don't like the companies that are driving the market higher.
I'm not in love with the Magnificent Seven domination, but I also think it's a mistake to fight it. In fact, I would be interested in buying a few Magnificent Seven stocks in 2024. So I'm not plugging my nose on the whole lot.
But the idea of simply carving out a portion of the investment and accepting it as something out of my control helps make the decision easier. After all, the amount invested in those stocks is sizable. A $3,525 investment in an S&P 500 index fund is essentially $1,000 in the Magnificent Seven and $2,525 in the rest of the market.
The biggest takeaway, or the reality that I've come to terms with, is that if you're going to be investing in the U.S. stock market, you have to accept the importance of these companies and the influence they will have. After all, if the Magnificent Seven stocks are selling off, chances are most of the market is going down, too.
The value of the U.S. stock market is dependent on big tech. Plain and simple. Running from this reality just because it is uncomfortable is the wrong move.
By considering the Magnificent Seven as a portfolio tax, I set myself up to be less frustrated if it sells off. For example, if the Magnificent Seven plummets 50% so that the S&P 500 falls 14% on the Magnificent Seven alone, I can be less upset because I've already viewed that part of the investment as something out of my control. By the same token, if the Magnificent Seven continues to outperform the S&P 500 and get bigger and bigger, I'll feel good that I didn't fight the current.
Find what works for you
The best way to invest is to leave room for creativity while being patient and trusting that the S&P 500 isn't perfect but is generally right. Being too contrarian and swimming upstream against the market can backfire and yield poor returns. Unless you're an extremely risk-averse investor focused on passive income and supplementing income in retirement, it's a good idea to have at least some exposure to big tech, even if it's just through an index or exchange-traded fund.
If you're like me and think the Magnificent Seven are generally overvalued, maybe the idea of giving up control of index fund investing will also work for you. I admit it might sound a bit silly, but the psychological side of investing is anything but that. When volatility spikes in the stock market, controlling your emotions can be the difference between staying on track and making a catastrophic financial decision. Like it or not, ignoring the Magnificent Seven would have been a big mistake in 2023 -- and might continue to be in 2024 and beyond.

As such, Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP and WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund USDU might experience some declines. These two ETFs are the prime beneficiaries of the rising dollar.

"January 30, 2024 — 08:31 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights%3A-apple-2,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – January 30, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.
Apple Q1 Earnings: Key Metrics to Watch
It's a highly critical week for earnings, with several mega-cap technology companies slated to reveal quarterly results. The strength of these mega-cap names has been admired by all, with many expecting positive results to keep overall market momentum flowing.
Perhaps the most popular of the bunch, market leader Apple will reveal quarterly results on February 1st after the market's close. The company has been on a solid earnings streak as of late, exceeding our consensus earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters.
Shares got a nice boost following its latest set of results, sparking a strong rally.
How do expectations stack up heading into the release? Let's take a quick look at headline estimates and a few key other metrics to keep an eye on within the release.
Headline Figures
Analysts have been bullish regarding the bottom line, with the $2.09 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up a modest 1.5% since November and suggesting growth of roughly 11% year-over-year.
Revenue expectations have been revised modestly lower, as the $117 billion quarterly sales estimate has been taken 1.4% lower over the same period.
Key Metrics
Apple's services portfolio has also been a great source of growth over the last several years. It includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and more.
For the quarter, we expect the company to post $23.3 billion in revenue from Services, nicely above the year-ago mark of $20.7 billion, reflecting 12.5% growth. Apple has consistently positively surprised on this metric as of late.
As expected, iPhone revenue will also be a big focus, particularly as the company continues to face competition in other markets. For the quarter, we expect Apple to post $68.6 billion in iPhone revenue, suggesting an increase of roughly 4% year-over-year.
iPhone results have been primarily mixed as of late, with the company falling short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases.
Valuation
Shares are trading at a premium relative to historical levels, with the current 28.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple sitting above the 25.2X five-year median. The forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio sits at 7.4X, near five-year highs and above the 6.0X five-year median.
Still, investors have had little issue forking up the premium given the company's dominant stance, as reflected by the share performance.
Bottom Line
We've got a loaded slate of earnings this week, with belovedApple a part of the reporting docket. Earnings estimates have been taken higher whereas revenue expectations have fallen modestly, with both items expected to be higher than the year-ago period.
Investors will closely watch the company's Services results as well as iPhone sales, two key growth drivers for Apple. Heading into the release, the stock is presently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"January 30, 2024 — 06:27 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/did-the-magnificent-seven-just-become-the-super-six,"The S&P 500 index delivered a gain of 24.3% last year, but it was led higher by a group of stocks dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven."" This cohort includes:
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)
Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)
Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)
The companies have a combined market value of $12.7 trillion, and here are the staggering returns they delivered in 2023:
NVDA Total Return Level data by YCharts
But 2024 is a new year, and one of the Magnificent Seven is stumbling. Tesla stock plunged in January due mostly to a disappointing financial report for the fourth quarter of 2023. Tesla's stock performance in 2024 so far is in stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers:
NVDA Total Return Level data by YCharts
CNBC personality Jim Cramer, who coined the FAANG acronym in 2017 to describe another group of tech stocks leading the market at the time, now believes Tesla should be booted from the Magnificent Seven. He came up with another name for the group: the ""Super Six.""
I think that stance makes sense in the short term, but here's why Tesla should retain its membership in the Magnificent Seven over the long term.
Tesla's primary business is in a rut
Tesla was the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) company by sales up until the end of 2023 when it was overtaken by China-based BYD. It seemed like Tesla had the entire EV market to itself for years, but new start-ups and legacy automakers have now established themselves in the industry.
Tesla delivered 1.2 million of its Model Y EV in 2023, making it the best-selling car globally across all categories. However, the company's share of U.S. EV sales overall fell to a record low of 55%, down from 65% in 2022. Even though the EV market continues to grow, consumers have more choices than ever, so Tesla's dominance is slowly fading.
The other challenge Tesla faced in 2023 was softening demand. High interest rates crimped consumer spending and sent monthly car payments soaring, which priced many potential buyers out of Tesla ownership. The company slashed the sticker prices of its entire lineup by an average of 25.1% throughout the year to offset the economic headwinds, which helped the EV maker hit its annual sales target of 1.8 million vehicles in total.
But 2024 could be even tougher. Tesla failed to issue any sales guidance, leaving investors in the dark. Analysts believe the company will sell 2.2 million vehicles, but that would represent an increase of just 22% compared to 2023, which is substantially below CEO Elon Musk's long-term annual growth target of 50%.
Tesla is now focused on developing a new EV at a lower price point (rumored to be around $25,000) to suit lower-income consumers. Production is expected to begin in 2025, and Musk thinks it will ignite a new wave of growth for the company's core business.
Image source: Tesla.
Tesla is also a leader in artificial intelligence
Tesla's core business might be struggling, but the company is a leading developer of fully autonomous self-driving software (FSD), which is powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Late last year, Musk said Tesla customers had completed over 500 million miles in the real world using beta versions of FSD. Since data is king when developing AI, that makes Tesla's technology arguably the most advanced in the industry.
In his Q4 conference call with investors, Musk highlighted the release of FSD version 12, which features an entirely new architecture. Over 330,000 lines of traditional computer code were replaced with neural networks, which means AI is now more involved in actual real-world decision-making. That will be key in complex driving situations that Tesla's FSD software hasn't encountered before.
Musk also revealed plans to ship early models of Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, next year. That's another piece of hardware powered by AI, and it could have a profound impact on the broader economy by replacing human workers in jobs like manufacturing. Robots would allow facilities to operate 24 hours per day, seven days a week, which would significantly boost productivity.
That's why Tesla deserves a spot in the Magnificent Seven
AI is one of the main reasons the Magnificent Seven stocks performed so well in 2023. Nvidia shares tripled in value thanks entirely to its data center chips, which were designed for AI workloads. Similarly, Microsoft and Amazon both invested billions of dollars into leading AI start-ups while also developing their own large language models (LLMs), applications, and even chips in-house.
Meta Platforms is using AI to curate the content feeds of its 3.1 billion daily users on Facebook and Instagram, which is increasing engagement. Alphabet is improving Google Search with AI, and Google Cloud now offers its business customers more than 100 LLMs to help them develop AI applications faster.
Even Apple is diving into the world of AI. Its new iPhone 15 Pro features the A17 Pro chip, which can handle AI workloads on-device. The company is developing LLMs in-house, and is rumored to be working on an AI chatbot application that could make full use of that new hardware.
Here's the bottom line: Tesla stock could suffer more downside in the short term while its EV sales slow, but technology and AI are the reasons it was included in the Magnificent Seven in the first place. After all, Ford, General Motors, and Rivian have invested heavily in EVs yet they are never discussed alongside companies like Nvidia or Microsoft -- but Tesla is.
FSD, AI, and robotics could transform Tesla's economics over the long term, which is why the stock should remain in the Magnificent Seven -- at least until something changes on those fronts.

"January 30, 2024 — 06:20 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-vanguard-russell-1000-growth-etf-vong-be-on-your-investing-radar-11,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market, the Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF (VONG) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/22/2010.
The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $18 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Growth
Large cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.
Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market, they also have higher valuations. Also, growth stocks are a type of equity that carries more risk compared to others. Even though growth stocks are more likely to outperform their value counterparts in strong bull markets, value stocks have a record of delivering better returns in almost all markets than growth stocks.
Costs
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.08%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.67%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 44.70% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Telecom round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 12.40% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).
Performance and Risk
VONG seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Growth Index before fees and expenses. The Russell 1000 Growth Index measures the performance of large-capitalization growth stocks in the United States.
The ETF has added about 5.10% so far this year and it's up approximately 38.30% in the last one year (as of 01/30/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $57.64 and $82.
The ETF has a beta of 1.07 and standard deviation of 21.90% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 444 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VONG is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $109.81 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $246.17 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.
Bottom-Line
An increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

"January 30, 2024 — 05:39 am EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-favor-amzn-over-aapl-ahead-of-upcoming-earnings,"Technology giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release quarterly earnings after the market closes on Thursday, February 1. Analysts’ consensus ratings reflect that Wall Street favors AMZN over AAPL ahead of their upcoming earnings. 
In particular, AMZN’s quarterly numbers should benefit from solid holiday sales numbers, stabilization in its cloud business (AWS), and its focus on reducing costs. After the Q4 earnings release, its stock price could rise further.
On the other hand, Apple offered lower-than-expected holiday sales guidance as its hardware sales are under pressure. If the company reports weak hardware sales in Q1, its share price may take a hit to some extent. Consequently, analysts are more bullish about AMZN stock. 
With this backdrop, let’s look at the Street’s forecast for their upcoming earnings.
AMZN: Q4 Expectations
Analysts expect AMZN to report revenue of $165.96 billion in Q4, up over 11% year-over-year. Solid holiday sales, durable growth in the advertising segment, and strength in its cloud business should drive its top line. 
Meanwhile, leverage from higher sales and cost reductions will likely cushion its earnings. Wall Street projects that the e-commerce giant will post EPS of $0.8 in Q4, up from $0.03 in the prior-year quarter.  
Is Amazon Stock Expected to Go Up?
AMZN stock has gained over 60% in one year. Despite this notable growth, Wall Street is bullish about its prospects.
Ahead of Q4 earnings, Telsey Advisory analyst Joe Feldman increased AMZN’s price target to $185 from $165. The analyst expects the company to benefit from solid holiday sales, the stabilization of AWS, and its focus on profitability. 
Including Feldman, AMZN stock has 37 unanimous Buy recommendations for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Analysts’ average price target of $187.77 suggests a further upside potential of 16.44%. 
It’s worth highlighting that options traders are pricing in a +/- 6.57% move on earnings, slightly lower than the previous quarter’s earnings-related move of 6.83%. The expected move is determined by computing the at-the-money straddle of the options closest to the expiration after the earnings announcement. Learn more about TipRanks’ Options tool here.
AAPL – Q1 Expectations
Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $117.99 billion in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024. This is roughly in line with the company’s prior-year sales of $117.22 billion. Softness in iPhone demand and an expected year-over-year decline in iPad and Wearables, Home, and Accessories will likely hurt AAPL’s top-line growth rate. However, strength in the Services business could continue to drive sales. 
Wall Street projects that AAPL will post earnings of $2.1 per share, up from $1.88 reported in the prior-year quarter. The analysts expect Apple’s bottom line to benefit from cost reductions.
Is Apple a Buy, Hold, or Sell?
Apple stock has gained nearly 35% over the past year, despite ongoing pressure on its product sales. Goldman Sachs analyst Mike Ng reiterated a Buy recommendation on AAPL stock on January 24. However, he lowered AAPL’s price target to $223 from $227. Further, the analyst lowered his EPS estimates. The analyst sees short-term headwinds from lower product sales and tough year-over-year comparisons. 
Overall, Apple stock has received 22 Buy, eight Hold, and one Sell recommendations for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Analysts’ average price target of $205.85 implies an upside potential of 7.36% from current levels. 
Meanwhile, options traders are pricing in a +/- 3.70% move on earnings, higher than the previous quarter’s earnings-related move of -0.52%.
Bottom Line
Both the tech giants, AMZN and AAPL, possess solid fundamentals that can drive long-term growth. However, analysts favor AMZN stock over AAPL ahead of the quarterly print. Further, AMZN stock has outperformed AAPL over the past year and offers a higher upside potential from current levels.

As January 2024 kicked in, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) received downgrades from analysts, resulting in some selling pressure affecting AAPL stock. As a result of this downside pressure, and the meteoric rise of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) over the past year, Apple has relinquished the reigns of the world’s largest company by market capitalization to Microsoft.
Now the second-largest publicly-traded company, some investors may wonder if Apple has lost its edge. After all, the company relies on the same product mix it has for years, and little in the way of innovation for its core product portfolio could weaken demand for new iPhones and other Apple devices.
The company has been increasing its sales from wearable tech, with nearly $40 billion coming from this segment. However, an ongoing lawsuit tied to its blood oxygen sensor technology has provided some growth concerns in this segment.
Services revenue and margin growth will likely continue to be the story for Apple moving forward. But with little in the way of top-line growth expected in the next couple years, the question is whether this stock is worth its valuation multiple of 31-times earnings.
Let’s dive in.
Why AAPL Stock Is Viewed As a Must-Buy in 2024
Apple is known for its reliability and consistent and substantial revenue and profits. These factors are rooted in two of the company’s greatest values: customer loyalty and brand strength.
With its vast international device presence, it boosts service revenue such as Apple Pay, Music, and App Store. It hit a record high in the past year, plus the company has a staggering cash reserve of almost $62 billion. 
Non-current marketable securities are at $100.5 billion, making Apple stand out from its competition despite returns to shareholders. 
One thing about Apple is the company also provides generous dividend payouts to its investors. From September 2022 to September 23, Apple paid over $15 billion in dividends and has spent about $77.5 billion on stock buybacks. In the recent quarter alone, the company returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders.
Despite its heavy investments in Apple’s services and products, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook expressed his optimism and enthusiasm for the Vision Pro, anticipating a new level of cloud computing. The jury remains out on whether this new product segment will be a hit, but it’s a step in the right direction.
New iOS 17.3 Security Features
On January 23, Apple released its newest iOS update: the iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3. The update became an instant buzz and talk of the week as it features a Stolen Device Protection, one of which other smartphone companies have yet to tap into.
The security features were made accessible and available to users in real time, unlike Google which had to make staggered launch dates for a similar security feature for their own products. The Stolen Device Protection feature allows users to enhance security for Apple devices that are stolen and have passcodes. 
The iOS update mandates both Touch ID and Face ID to change biometric authentication after an hour of losing the device or if the device is not in a familiar location.
Aside from the security feature, the iOS updates also include new sets of wallpapers, hotel support for AirPlay, and collaborative playlist features. Although these features should’ve existed earlier, there are rumors that Android devices will also release the same features soon.
A Steady Growth Stock
Most of Apple’s revenue (more than 50% of its top line) is driven by the iPhone. Despite Apple’s market share of only 20% of global smartphone shipments, the iPhone currently holds 80% market share in terms of the industry’s operating income. This is what drives Apple’s incredible profitability.
Aside from its core iPhone division, Apple’s strength also comes from its expansive ecosystem. Its growing services, mainly iCloud, NEws, TV+, Apple Pay, and Music have shown impressive revenue growth, which surged 9% year-over-year this past quarter. This segment constitutes 22% of the total sales of Apple, at an impressive 71% gross margin.
Apple’s strong Services segment numbers not only highlight the profitability of the company but also reiterates the importance of Apple’s brand and the loyalty of its customer base.
AAPL Stock Remains a Buy
Yes, AAPL stock is a company trading at a valuation premium with slowing growth. Yes, there are plenty of headwinds to consider. And if we do see a recession, consumers will likely wait a year or two to upgrade their $1,500 phone.
However, it’s also clear that Apple is innovating in terms of its products and services. The company’s recent security upgrades, the release of the Vision Pro, and other upcoming product releases could spur future growth many aren’t considering right now. Thus, I think Apple has to remain a part of investor portfolios right now, whether they like it or not. This is a company that’s just too solid and consistent to avoid right now.

"January 29, 2024 — 04:51 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-q1-earnings%3A-key-metrics-to-watch,"It’s a highly critical week for earnings, with several mega-cap technology companies slated to reveal quarterly results. The strength of these mega-cap names has been admired by all, with many expecting positive results to keep overall market momentum flowing.
Perhaps the most popular of the bunch, market leader Apple AAPL will reveal quarterly results on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has been on a solid earnings streak as of late, exceeding our consensus earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters.
Shares got a nice boost following its latest set of results, sparking a strong rally.

How do expectations stack up heading into the release? Let’s take a quick look at headline estimates and a few key other metrics to keep an eye on within the release.
Headline Figures
Analysts have been bullish regarding the bottom line, with the $2.09 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up a modest 1.5% since November and suggesting growth of roughly 11% year-over-year.

Revenue expectations have been revised modestly lower, as the $117 billion quarterly sales estimate has been taken 1.4% lower over the same period.

Key Metrics
Apple’s services portfolio has also been a great source of growth over the last several years. It includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and more.
For the quarter, we expect the company to post $23.3 billion in revenue from Services, nicely above the year-ago mark of $20.7 billion, reflecting 12.5% growth. Apple has consistently positively surprised on this metric as of late, as we can see below.

As expected, iPhone revenue will also be a big focus, particularly as the company continues to face competition in other markets. For the quarter, we expect Apple to post $68.6 billion in iPhone revenue, suggesting an increase of roughly 4% year-over-year.
iPhone results have been primarily mixed as of late, with the company falling short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases.

Valuation
Shares are trading at a premium relative to historical levels, with the current 28.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple sitting above the 25.2X five-year median. The forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio sits at 7.4X, near five-year highs and above the 6.0X five-year median.
Still, investors have had little issue forking up the premium given the company’s dominant stance, as reflected by the share performance.

Bottom Line
We’ve got a loaded slate of earnings this week, with beloved Apple AAPL a part of the reporting docket. Earnings estimates have been taken higher whereas revenue expectations have fallen modestly, with both items expected to be higher than the year-ago period.
Investors will closely watch the company’s Services results as well as iPhone sales, two key growth drivers for Apple. Heading into the release, the stock is presently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"January 29, 2024 — 04:27 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-sp-500-hits-fresh-closing-high-ahead-of-fed-meeting-big-tech-earnings,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Monday as market participants looked ahead to this week's slew of megacap earnings, economic data and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting.
All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced, with the tech-laden Nasdaq .IXIC enjoying the largest percentage gain.
The S&P 500 .SPX notched yet another record closing high.
With the bellwether index up 3.3% so far in the first month of 2024, BlackRock raised its overall U.S. stocks view to ""overweight"" from ""neutral.""
""Today is the calm before the storm,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. ""This is a truly headline-driven week, with earnings, the Fed, the jobs report and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties.""
""So with stocks at all time high, if we see any disappointments that could upset the apple cart and cause some well-deserved volatility,"" Detrick added.
A spate of earnings from high profile tech and tech-adjacent momentum stocks waits in the wings, starting on Tuesday with Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Wednesday and culminating on Thursday with Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O and Meta Platforms Inc META.O.
The Federal Open Markets Committee is scheduled to convene on Tuesday for its two-day monetary policy meeting, at which its voting members are widely expected to leave the key Fed funds target rate unchanged at 5.25% to 5.50%.
""Powell is probably going to be somewhat cautious. The Fed doesn't want to be burned by inflation, and will push back on the (expected) March cut as a near certainty,"" Detrick said.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers have warned not to expect interest rate cuts before inflation cools down to its average 2% annual target, but have also vowed to remain agile as they respond to economic data.
This week's roster of economic reports includes the labor market, with the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, ADP, fourth-quarter employment costs, productivity, and planned layoffs, and the January employment report on Friday.
Case-Shiller home prices, consumer confidence, the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers' index, construction spending and factory orders are also on deck.
Robust economic data of late - particularly last week's strong gross domestic product and personal consumption expenditures data - have simultaneously calmed fears of imminent recession and tossed cold water on hopes that the Fed would begin cutting interest rates as soon as March.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 224.02 points, or 0.59%, to 38,333.45. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 36.96 points, or 0.76%, at 4,927.93 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC advanced 172.68 points, or 1.12%, to 15,628.04.
Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by consumer discretionary .SPLRCD, up 1.37%, followed by a 0.97% gain in information technology .SPLRCT.
Energy sector .SPNY was the sole declining sector.
Robot vacuum maker iRobot IRBT.Oslid 8.8% as the company and Amazon scrapped merger plans in the face of opposition from EU antitrust regulators.
Meta Platforms META.O rose 1.7% after brokerage Jefferies raised its target price on the stock to $455 from $425.
Warner Bros Discovery WBD.O lost 1.2% as brokerage Wells Fargo downgraded the streaming platform to ""equal weight"" from ""overweight.""
Financial technology firm SoFi TechnologiesSOFI.O jumped 20.2% after posting a fourth-quarter profit.
Stocks on the NYSE scored 397 new highs and 50 new lows.
On the Nasdaq 2,975 stocks rose and 1,314 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a roughly 2.3-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 226 new highs and 101 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 10.3 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.5 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

"January 29, 2024 — 04:00 pm EST",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-stock-nasdaq%3Aaapl%3A-vision-pro-is-a-potential-silver-lining,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the largest manufacturers of high-tech devices in the world, has faced scrutiny for failing to launch a blockbuster product in recent years. The Apple Vision Pro, the company’s first virtual reality headset, is widely seen as a potential silver lining that could become the biggest product launch since AirPods.
The Apple Vision Pro will be available for purchase in the U.S. starting on February 2, and the company is yet to announce an international launch date. Although I am beginning to be optimistic about what’s in store for Apple this year, I am neutral on AAPL stock, nonetheless.
Looking Beyond Encouraging Demand Trends
The Apple Vision Pro has been available for pre-order since January 19, starting at a price of $3,499 for the 256 GB version. For comparison, Oculus Quest 3, the latest AR headset developed and sold by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), starts at $499 for the 128 GB version. The hefty price of the Apple Vision Pro raised concerns when the product was unveiled last June, but data from the first weekend of pre-order availability suggests strong initial demand.
According to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple sold between 160,000 and 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend, which suggests the device was sold out, as expected, within the first weekend itself. As the analyst observed and reported, expected shipping times for all Vision Pro devices extended to five to seven weeks immediately after pre-ordering was enabled – a clear indication that the Vision Pro was sold out.
There is, however, a major difference between blockbuster iPhone models and the Vision Pro. Typically, iPhones see a steady rise in shipping times for at least 48 hours after the availability of pre-ordering, but Vision Pro shipping times remained steady in the first 48 hours after the initial burst. This, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, serves as a warning sign.
Apple has a cult-like follower base that lines up to purchase new devices as and when they are released. A blockbuster product will not only attract this strong follower base but will also appeal to the masses. The waning demand for the Vision Pro after an initial burst suggests the VR headsets are yet to attract mass tech consumers.
The AR/VR Market Has Room for Disruption
Empirical evidence suggests that Apple has been wildly successful in aggressively gaining market share in various consumer tech niches such as smartphones, personal computers, and smart watches despite not enjoying first-mover advantages in any of these markets. Apple’s success stems from the company’s proven ability to develop appealing tech products based on a deep understanding of consumer preferences.
Today, the AR/VR headset market is at an infant stage, with IDC projecting just 8.1 million AR/VR device shipments in 2023. According to Counterpoint Research, Meta dominated this market in the third quarter of 2023, accounting for 49% of all device shipments. Counterpoint data reveals that headset shipments plummeted by 29% year-over-year in Q3 due to a lack of compelling headset launches.
The relatively small size of the AR/VR headset market leaves ample room for disruption, and Apple has a reputation for successfully exploiting similar opportunities in other market segments.
Apple’s Scale Problem
Apple has grown in leaps and bounds since the first-ever iPhone was released in 2007. The massive size and scale of the company, however, has made it difficult for Apple to meet Wall Street’s growth expectations in recent years. For context, in Fiscal 2023, total revenue declined close to 3% year-over-year to $383 billion, while net income also declined by 2.8%.
The problem with Apple’s massive scale is that it takes a wildly successful product to move the needle for the company from a financial performance perspective. In 2024, Apple expects to sell 500,000 Vision Pro units, bringing in revenue of at least $1.75 billion. This may seem like an encouraging figure in isolation, but in comparison to the almost $400 billion in revenue Apple is projected to bring in this year, Vision Pro sales seem trivial.
Even if Apple sells double the projected Vision Pro units for 2024, this segment will still account for less than 1% of total company sales this year. Going by this understanding, it seems fair to conclude that Vision Pro will fail to meaningfully impact Apple’s fundamentals in the foreseeable future.
The highly anticipated VR headset, however, has the potential to improve the market sentiment toward Apple and ascertain the company’s position as a dominant tech innovator if unit sales exceed Wall Street expectations this year.
Is Apple Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?
Apple is one of the most followed companies in the market. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are often divided about Apple's prospects, but they're currently bullish overall. The stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Here's what some analysts have said about Apple.
On January 18, Bank of America Securities upgraded Apple and raised the stock's price target from $208 to $225, citing the company’s promising AI product roadmap, among other bullish developments such as the improved outlook for the services segment. BofA also claimed that Vision Pro sales could eventually surpass iPad revenue in the long run, with VR going mainstream.
On January 23, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added Apple to its US 1 list, which is a collection of the bank’s best investment ideas.
Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), in its Weekly Warm-Up Report, published on January 22, identified Apple as one of the top high-quality growth stocks in the U.S. among 56 other companies that are seemingly well-positioned to deliver alpha returns this year.
Last week, Piper Sandler highlighted Apple as the 3rd most attractive pick out of Magnificent 7 stocks, behind Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms.
Overall, based on the ratings of 31 Wall Street analysts, the average Apple stock price target is $205.85, which implies upside of 7.5% from the current market price.
The Takeaway: Vision Pro is Exciting, Apple’s Valuation Is Not
Apple is heading into exciting days, with the first batch of Vision Pro units expected to be shipped out in the coming weeks. Although the Vision Pro may not have a strong impact on Apple’s earnings this year, the market may reward Apple handsomely if the device attracts tech bulls and positive reviews from tech enthusiasts. Apple, however, looks expensively valued at a forward P/E of 29 compared to its five-year average of 25.
